tails (4.10) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Security fixes
    - Upgrade Tor Browser to 9.5.4-build1 (Closes: #17885).
    - Upgrade Linux kernel to 5.7.0-2 at 5.7.10-1 (Closes: #17841,
      #17834).

  * Bugfixes
    - Make iPhone Tethering work by adding udev rule to disable MAC
      spoofing for it (Closes: #17820).
    - Remove broken Thunderbird protocol selection. This code has been
      a no-op in practice since at least Tails 4.0.  We've decided to
      reject #17276 and investigate what the biggest problems are for
      email in Tails with slow/shitty Internet connections:
      default'ing to IMAP may, or may not, be part of these
      problems (Closes #17276).

  * Minor improvements and updates
    - Upgrade to Tor 0.4.3.6 (Closes: #17835).
    - Upgrade to Electrum 4.0.2 (Closes: #17828).
    - Hide Thunderbird welcome message: it is not relevant in the
      context of Tails.  For example, it feels weird that we would
      encourage users to donate to Thunderbird about as loudly as we
      encourage them to donate to Tails.  Besides, the default message
      is retrieved from the web when Thunderbird starts.  We don't
      need this extra network activity.
    - import-translations: use *_release branches instead of
      *_completed branches. The new *_release branches contain exactly
      what we want, i.e. all reviewed translations from
      Transifex. While the *_completed branches only contain PO files
      for languages that are fully translated (Closes: #16774).

  * Build system
    - Upgrade snapshot of the Debian archive to 2020081601, including
      the 10.5 point release of Debian Buster (Closes: #17790).
    - On Bullseye and newer: use custom, fake, unversioned python
      packages. The unversioned python packages are not shipped in
      Bullseye/sid anymore, and even old versions are not installable
      anymore (Closes: #17858).
    - Import vagrant-libvirt's create_box.sh script. It's not included
      in vagrant-libvirt 0.1.2-1 anymore (Closes: #17872).

  * Test suite
    - Improve robustness for scenario "The Additional Software dpkg
      hook notices when persistence is locked down while installing a
      package".
    - Improve robustness for scenario "Use GNOME Disks to unlock a USB
      drive that has a basic VeraCrypt volume with a keyfile".
    - Improve robustness of cloning a Git repository.
    - Don't hammer resources of the system under test while
      installing/removing packages. I see every such dpkg|grep call
      takes about 0.3 seconds on lizard, i.e. 30% of the 1 second
      default delay between checks, which I suspect is enough to slow
      down the package installation/removal we're exercising.
    - Update expected title of the GitLab page we use
    - Rubocop: target Ruby 2.5 (Buster).

    - Upgrade VirtualBox guest modules to 6.1.12-dfsg-5.

  * Build system
    - Automate post-release GitLab updates, using gitlab-triage (Closes: #17589).
    - Fix a lot of possible problems spotted by ShellCheck, thanks to Paul Wise.
    - Stop installing custom firmware: firmware-realtek 20200421-1 includes it
      (See: #17786, #17323).
    - Update Thunderbird patches (Closes: #6156, #17808).

 -- Tails developers <tails@boum.org>  Mon, 27 Jul 2020 09:03:10 +0200

tails (4.8) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Major changes
    - Welcome Screen: after a large refactoring we now can persist
      settings (See: #17136)! Currently it is limited to the newly
      added option that controls whether the Unsafe Browser is allowed
      to start (#17085). In the next major release we'll support all
      options.

  * Security fixes
    - Allow to disable the Unsafe Browser in the Welcome Screen
      (Closes: #17085). The Unsafe Browser can be used by exploits to
      deanonymize the Tails user (for details, see: #15635).
    - Upgrade Tor Browser to 9.5.1-build2 (Closes: 17782).
    - Thunderbird:
      * Upgrade to Thunderbird 68.9.0 (DSA-4702).
      * Disable unsafe MX automatic configuration method (Closes:
        #17277).
      * Disable unsafe MS Exchange automatic configuration method
        (Closes: #17654).
    - Upgrade Linux kernel to linux-image-5.6.0-2 at 5.6.14-2 (Closes:
      #17611, #17620).
    - Upgrade gnutls28-based packages to 3.6.7-4+deb10u4 (DSA-4697).
    - Upgrade intel-microcode to 3.20200609.2~deb10u1 (DSA-4701).

  * Bugfixes
    - Trigger emergency shutdown on resume when the boot device was
      removed while suspended (Closes: #16787).
    - Thunderbird: make searching in messages (Find bar and Find in
      This Message) work again (Closes: #17328).
    - Ensure Mac Spoofing Panic messages will be correctly displayed
      (Closes: #17779). udev may close child processes when a process
      associated with a rule (/etc/udev/rules) terminates so we wait
      for those processes before exiting.
    - Wrap `seahorse-tool --import` so it is handled by `gpg --import`
      (Closes: #17183). This makes importing binary keys via GNOME
      Files integration possible again.

  * Minor improvements and updates
    - Upgrade to tor 0.4.3.5-1 (Closes: #17741).
    - Upgrade LibreOffice to 1:6.1.5-3+deb10u6.
    - Upgrade VirtualBox guest modules to 6.1.10-dfsg-1.
    - Append Unsafe Browser setting to WhisperBack debug info.

  * Build system
    - Upgrade snapshot of the Debian archive to 2020061003, including
      the 10.4 point release of Debian Buster (Closes: #17620).
    - Tor Browser AppArmor profile: update patch to apply on top of
      0.3.2-11 (Closes: #17612)
    - Thunderbird AppArmor profile: update patch to apply on top of
      68.9.0 (Closes: #17769).

  * Test suite
    - Establish a coding standards baseline on our Ruby code base
      using Rubocop (Closes: #17646). This *MASSIVE* change includes
      mainly stylistic fixes and linting but also a few bug fixes,
      some dead code removal and code simplifications/refactorings,
      spelling fixes, improved gherkin and even removal the of
      a few duplicated tests and merging of very similar tests.
    - Improve robustness of navigating the GRUB menu in UEFI mode, and
      consequently drop the @fragile tag on the UEFI boot scenario
      (Closes: #13459).
    - Allow configuring the number of vCPUs given to TailsToaster.
      Based on work done by kytv (♥) on #6729. On powerful hardware
      with many CPUs, Tails boots much faster with >2 vCPUs given to
      TailsToaster.
    - Disable desktop size and clipboard interference between the host
      system and the system under test when using --view.
    - Ensure we run post_snapshot_restore_hook every time it's needed.
    - Fix running with XDG_SESSION_TYPE unset (Closes: #17596).
    - Always test the localized start up page of the Unsafe Browser.
    - Add --keep-chutney option to keep Chutney data, but no
      snapshots, between runs.
    - Revert "Test suite: disable tests about notifications in case of
      MAC spoofing failure (refs: #10774)"
    - Verify that the Unsafe Browser is disabled by default.
    - Test suite: fix --image-bumping-mode.

tails (4.5~rc1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Major changes
    - Migrate from aufs to overlayfs (Closes: #8415). This change touches
      many components which won't all be listed individually, but some
      highlights are listed below:
      ⋅ Adjust the build system to stop building the aufs kernel module.
      ⋅ Switch the kernel command line from union=aufs to union=overlayfs.
      ⋅ Adjust AppArmor profiles (Closes: #9045, #12112).
      . Adapt chroot-browsers (Closes: #12105).
      ⋅ Drop the aufs Git submodule.
      ⋅ Make memory erasure feature compatible with overlayfs
        (Closes: #15146).
      ⋅ Make Upgrader support and also generate overlayfs-based IUKs by
       default (Closes: #9373).
    - Use GRUB with Secure Boot support for x86_64 (Closes: #6560, #15806).
      This is also a large change, touching many components:
      ⋅ Install grub from bullseye.
      ⋅ Introduce a custom grub configuration file.
      ⋅ Use a custom background image.
      ⋅ Mimick Debian Installer's efi-image build script to handle all
        details in binary local hooks.
      ⋅ Add SYSLINUX in the syslinux bootloader menu, to make it easier to
        troubleshoot GRUB vs. syslinux issues (Closes: #17538).
      ⋅ Upgrader: Adjust to also handle files in EFI/debian when dealing
        with file removals.
      ⋅ Adjust test suite.
    - Migrate test suite from Sikuli to a combination of OpenCV (image
      matching), xdotool (mouse interaction), plus libvirt's send-key
      (keyboard interaction) (Closes: #15460). This is another major
      changes, allowing the test suite to run on Buster-based systems,
      touching various areas of the test suite, among which:
      ⋅ Add workaround for the Greeter when restoring snapshot.
      ⋅ Fix dependencies for Buster.
      ⋅ Replace some Sikuli-based options with some OpenCV-based ones
        (e.g. --retry-find → --image-bumping-mode).
      ⋅ Handle non-English keyboards.
      ⋅ Fix --capture on Buster and above.
      ⋅ Deal with Buster having migrated from avconv to ffmpeg.

  * Security fixes

      source tree with the Vagrant box).
    - Import persistence-setup.git from its own repository into tails.git
      (Closes: #17526, #6487).
    - IUK: ensure rsync runtime dependency is installed.

  * Test suite
    - Adjust for the aufs → overlayfs migration (Closes: #12106, #17440,
      #17451).
    - run_test_suite: don't print usage on error.
    - run_test_suite: --view/--vnc-server-only are only supported on x11.
    - Optimize checking if file is empty.
    - Speed up some test failures to avoid resource starvation.

    - Upgrade virtualbox to 6.1.4-dfsg-1.

  * Build system
    - Vagrant build box: disable mitigation features for CPU
      vulnerabilities (Closes: #17386). Given the kind of things we do in

      such as Spectre and Meltdown can be exploited in there.  Let's
      reclaim some of the performance cost of the corresponding mitigation
      features.

      #17112). In some cases, the previous code would overwrite a
      non-empty backup file with an empty one, making it harder to
      recover from the already painful #10976.
    - create-usb-image-from-iso: Run syslinux within proper chroot
      (Closes: #17179). Previously we ran syslinux from the host,
      which can lead to bugs if its versions differs from the one
      inside the chroot (which is what Tails will use later). Thanks
      to Johan Blåbäck for the patch!
    - Tails Upgrader: Fix progress bar not pulsating and hide useless
      OK button (Closes: #16603).

  * Minor improvements and updates
    - Upgrade tor to 0.4.2.6 (Closes: #17059).
    - Install the trezor package, which adds a command-line (only)
      tool for managing Trezor devices (Closes: #17463). Thanks to
      Pavol Rusnak for the patch!
    - As a consequence of the Linux kernel upgrade we also:
      * Upgrade aufs to 5.4.3 20200127.
      * Install VirtualBox guest tools and kernel modules from sid.

  * Build system
    - Upgrade snapshot of the Debian archive to 2020020302, including
      the 10.3 point release of Debian Buster (Closes: #17458).
    - Add opt-in caching of the wiki (Closes: #15342).
    - Use mksquashfs' -no-exports option even when the fastcomp build
      option is set. "fastcomp" is supposed to only tweak SquashFS
      compression settings, but so far it was also disabling the
      -no-exports option that we set for our release builds.
    - Drop a bunch of packages installed for ikiwiki for various
      (obsoloete) resons:
      * libfile-chdir-perl, libyaml-perl and libxml-simple-perl which
        was needed back when we built our own ikiwiki from Git…  a
        looong time ago.
      * libtext-multimarkdown-perl used multimarkdown ikiwiki which
        its doubtful we ever will use.
      * libhtml-scrubber-perl, libhtml-template-perl,
        libhtml-parser-perl, libyaml-libyaml-perl and liburi-perl
        which are already installed as ikiwiki dependencies.
    - Install libimage-magick-perl instead of the perlmagick
      transitional package.
    - Don't install obsolete dependencies whois and eatmydata.
    - Consistently validate individual build options as we parse them.
      This is consistent with how we handled "fastcomp" already. Only
      compatibility checks between multiple build options really need
      to happen later, once we've parsed all build options.
    - Remove 5 years old transition code
    - Fully provision the Vagrant box every time it starts, and
      partially re-provision it for every build.
    - Behave correctly when disabling a previously set "offline" or
      "vmproxy+extproxy" build option.  Previously, setting one of
      these build options *once* would taint the Vagrant box forever
      with the resulting apt-cacher-ng configuration.
    - Shrink the apt-cacher-ng cache after a successful build too
      (Closes: #17288).
    - Set up infrastructure to retrieve log file from the VM even on
      build failure (Closes: #7749).
    - Always build from a fresh Git clone.
    - Set the permissions that Vagrant needs inside the source tree
      (Closes: #11411, #16607, #17289).

  * Test suite
    - Remove Seahorse key synchronization scenarios. These 2 scenarios
      never pass due to #17169, so currently:
      * They don't teach us anything new → no benefit.
      * Every time a developer looks at test suite results,
        they need to filter out this known problem, which takes time
        and trains us to ignore problems.

tails (4.1.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Bugfixes
    - Drop all network drivers from the initramfs to shrink its size

    - Dogtail'ify all interactions with gedit (Closes: #17028).
    - New test: ensure that no experimental APT suite is enabled
      for deb.torproject.org (Closes: #16931).
    - Remove dead IRC-related code and dependencies.
    - Take into account that Evince and Tor Browser's print-to-file dialogs
      are rendered in a subtly different manner.
    - Drop fragile tag for actual Tails bugs (#17007).
    - Drop compatibility code for Cucumber < 2.4.0 (Closes: #17083).
    - Fix regression in the Persistent browser bookmarks scenario
      (Closes: #17125).

tails (4.0~beta2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * All changes included in Tails 3.16, see the corresponding changelog entry.

  * Major changes
    - Upgrade tor to 0.4.1.5 (Closes: #16986).

  * Security fixes
    - Upgrade the Linux kernel to 5.2.0-2 (Closes: #16942).
      This mitigates the Spectre v1 swapgs vulnerability (CVE-2019-1125).
      Accordingly, aufs to aufs5.2 20190805.
    - Install enigmail from Bullseye (Closes: #16738).
      This fixes CVE-2019-12269.

  * Bugfixes
    - tails-unblock-network: only sleep until all-net-blacklist.conf is gone,
      instead of unconditionally delaying the login process for 5 seconds
      (Closes: #16805).
    - Terminate GDM's GNOME session after the amnesia user logs in,
      to free 200-300 MiB of memory (Closes: #12092).
      Temporarily enable GDM debug logs so we get enough information to fix
      any issue this might cause.
    - Make our KeePassXC wrapper translatable (Closes: #16952).
    - Adjust boot-time backports APT pinning for Buster.
    - Ensure we don't install unwanted packages even if they become
      "Priority: standard" again (Closes: #16949).
    - Move some GNOME apps to different menu categories (Closes: #16981).
    - Update HTP pools: replace boum.org (invalid certificate) with puscii.nl,
      replace www.myspace.com with myspace.com (the former redirects to
      the latter).
    - AppArmor: allow OnionShare to open URLs with Tor Browser (Closes: #16914).
    - Make file transfers with Spice reliable.

  * Minor improvements and updates
    - Greeter: improve formatting of printed exceptions.
    - Use the same icon for Tails Documentation in the Applications menu
      as on te Desktop (Closes: #16800).
    - Drop migration path from GnuPG persistent configuration created
      in the Tails 2.x era.
    - Remove various hacks that we don't need on Buster anymore.
    - Stop installing libcaribou-gtk3-module (Closes: #16757).
    - Stop installing python-cairo: mat2 does not use it anymore.
    - tails-unblock-network: have udev reload the databases it uses.
      This should avoid our fix for #16805 introducing regressions.

  * Build system
    - Bump APT snapshot of the 'debian' and 'torproject' archives
      to 2019090202.
    - Import the Greeter codebase into tails.git (Closes: #16912).
    - Explicitly install gnome-shell to make the set of installed packages
      more deterministic (related to #16947).
    - Don't try to follow symlinks when normalizing timestamps on source files.
    - Add missing "set -u" to build-time hook.
    - Use consistent method to extract translatable strings from Glade files.
    - Create gdm-tails related files from the original GNOME files
      (Closes: #12551).
    - Stop installing libimage-exiftool-perl explicitly: mat2 depends on it
      already.
    - Rakefile: disable compression when retrieving artifacts via scp.
      This makes this build step faster on systems that have SSH compression
      enabled by default.
    - import-translations: use tails-misc_release for tails.git's PO files
      (i.e. the Tails part of #16774).
    - Use squashfs-tools from sid (Closes: #16637).
    - Lower VM_MEMORY_BASE to 1536M.
    - Remove unneeded package cleanup (Closes: #16950).

  * Test suite
    - New scenario: installing with GNOME Disks from a USB image
      (Closes: #16004).
    - New scenarios: VeraCrypt PIM support (Closes: #15946).
    - Revert timeout bump that's not needed anymore.
    - Add a showing method on Dogtail objects.
    - VeraCrypt: ensure the temporary keyfile file is not garbage collected
      while we still need it.
    - Remote shell: print traceback to stderr so we can see it.
    - Install Dogtail from Bullseye and run it with Python 3 (Closes: #16976).
      This gives us UTF-8 support. Accordingly, drop anonym's "showingOnly"
      patch that was merged upstream, and port some test suite code to Dogtail,
      which we could not do before it got UTF-8 support.
    - Dogtail'ify some steps.
    - Make "^the Tor Browser shows the "([^"]+)" error$" step more robust
      (Closes: #11592.
    - Make the "the support documentation page opens in Tor Browser" step more
      robust (Closes: #15321)
    - Remove a bunch of obsolete @fragile tags, update the reasons why
      the remaining ones are fragile, and add some missing @fragile tags.
    - Drop useless code based on wrong assumptions (refs: #13470).
    - Make the "I set an administration password" step more robust.

tails (4.0~beta1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Major changes
    - Upgrade to a snapshot of Debian 10 (Buster) from 2018-08-06.

  * Removed features
    - Remove scribus completely (refs: 16290).
    - Remove LibreOffice Math (#16911).

  * Bugfixes
    - Fix Electrum wrapper's persistence check (Closes: #16821).
    - Remove pre-generated Pidgin accounts (Closes: #16744).
    - Hide the security level button in the unsafe browser (Closes:
      #16735).
    - Only hide unlocked TailsData partitions from the boot device
      (Closes: #16789).

  * Minor improvements and updates
    - Remove KeePassX and replace it with KeePassXC (Closes:
      #15297). As KeePassX was used around for a longer time, we don't
      need automatic upgrading cappability from old KeePass file
      format (Tails 2 times). The user can still import those old
      files, if they want to access it.
    - Ship a pre-compiled AppArmor policy to make boot faster (Closes:
      #16138).
    - Change the splash screen for Tails 4.0 (#16837). Add SVG source
      while we're at it!
    - Remove our predefined bookmarks and ship default upstream Tor
      Browser bookmarks instead (Closes: #15895).
    - Install bolt for improved Thunderbolt support (Closes: #5463).
    - Don't display the Home launcher on the desktop (Closes: #16799).
      Since the switch to the desktop-icons GNOME Shell extension, the
      nicer XDG-blah name ("Home" in English, translated in many
      languages) is not used to label this launcher anymore: instead,
      the name of the directory is displayed, in this case: "amnesia",
      which makes no sense to our users. Our other options to fix that
      are more costly and we've decided a while ago, when I proposed
      to remove the desktop icons, to keep them until they were too
      expensive to support. So this one goes: we have the Places menu
      already.
    - Add Files to favorite apps (Closes: #16799). This gives another
      entry point to the home folder, which partially mitigates any UX
      regression that might be caused by the previous changelog entry.
    - Explicitly install imagemagick. We ship it on purpose (see
      [[contribute/meetings/201707]]).
    - MAT:
      * Drop obsolete optional MAT dependencies it isn't using any
        more.
      * Stop explicitly installing MAT dependencies. The package
        depends on those so we don't need to pull them ourselves.
    - Move translations from root-terminal.desktop.in into own PO
      files (Closes: #15335).
    - Drop obsolete live-boot patch: the bug it workarounds only
      happens with CONFIG_AUFS_DEBUG enabled. We disable
      CONFIG_AUFS_DEBUG in config/chroot_local-hooks/13-aufs and the
      Debian package did it as well (Refs: Debian#886329).
    - Rename /usr/share/amnesia to /usr/share/tails.
    - Drop APT pinning for non-existing live.debian.net, that we
      haven't used since 2010.
    - Don't install the cryptsetup initramfs integration and startup
      scripts (Closes: #16264). We probably only need the binaries.
      Not installing the initramfs integration will get rid of some
      noise
    - Don't install full-blown cryptsetup, take 2 (refs: #15690). We've
      stopped installing it (#16264) but this branch independently
      reintroduced it.
    - Disable live-tools.service (Closes: #16324). This service is only
      useful to display the "Please remove the live-medium, close the
      tray (if any) and press ENTER to continue:" prompt on shutdown,
      that we don't want to display in Tails: shutdown and memory
      erasure should not require a confirmation once the user has
      triggered it. In Stretch this code was broken and we were
      relying on this. But the Buster upgrade of this code has
      repaired it, so I sometimes see that prompt. This might also
      explain some issues such as #16312.
    - AppArmor: allow cups-brf, driverless, and gutenprint53+usb
      printer backends (Closes: #15030). Technically, cups-brf and
      driverless are not third-party and should be confined more
      strictly with "ixr", under the cupsd profile. But I don't know
      how to to test these backends and confining them more strictly
      may break them.  Anyway, that's an upstream matter: the purpose
      of our Tails-specific patch is to replace the third party
      backends /usr/lib/cups/backend/* catch all rule, that doesn't
      work for us, and not to keep the list of backends which come
      with CUPS up-to-date.
    - Make export_gnome_env() exit early if gnome-shell isn't running.
      Without this e.g. the automated test suite, which will call
      export_gnome_env() before gnome-shell is running, will have its
      journal polluted with errors about this. This is not the first
      time I see this and get worried and waste minutes investigating,
      so let's just fix it.

  * Build system
    - Bump VM_MEMORY_BASE to 2048M. With the previous 1024M setting,
      the squashfs preparation gets OOM-killed.
    - Limit the memory used by mksquashfs to 512M (Closes: #16177). By
      default mksquashfs will use 25% of the physical memory. So when
      we use the "ram" build option, build in a VM with 13GB of RAM,
      of which up to 12G is supposed to be used by the build tmpfs,
      mksquashfs will try using 13/4 = 3.25G of memory. And then it
      will get reaped by the OOM killer more or less occasionally
      depending on how much space is really used in the build tmpfs
      and how much memory the rest of the system is using. So let's
      limit the memory used by mksquashfs to 50% of the memory we
      allocate to the build VM, excluding the part of it that we
      expect tmpfs data to fill. In passing, the fact mksquashfs does
      not get killed every time suggests that our current
      BUILD_SPACE_REQUIREMENT value exceeds the real needs of a build:
      a value around 10 or 11G should be enough. But that will be for
      another commit.
    - Use xz with default settings to compress non-release SquashFS
      (refs: #16177). squashfs-tools 1:4.3-11, used to build
      feature/buster, does not consistently honor the value passed to
      -mem: the xz compressor does but at least the gzip and lzo ones
      don't. This makes the build often fail because mksquashfs gets
      reaped by the OOM-killer. Our only other option is currently to
      bump the build VM memory a lot, which is going to be painful on
      developers' systems and might not be an option on Jenkins. So
      let's fall back to xz with default settings (not the crazy slow
      but efficient we use at release time) when building non-release
      images.
    - Rename the "gzipcomp" build option to "fastcomp". What matters
      in the "user" interface is not the exact algorithm that's used,
      it's the fact it's supposed to be faster than the compression
      settings we use to build releases. We may have to changes these
      fast(er) settings occasionally, possibly to use a non-gzip
      algorithm. So let's keep supporting "gzipcomp" for backward
      compatibility but stop documenting it. Instead, support and
      document "fastcomp".
    - Add the vmproxy+extproxy build option. When enabled, use the
      vmproxy but configure it to in turn use the exproxy set via the
      http_proxy environment variable.
    - Support the case when we don't ship a custom AppArmor feature
      set. Let's keep this sanity check for the times when we do ship
      a custom feature set, but building an ISO without a custom one
      should remain supported. (Closes: #15149)
    - Don't remove packages whose deinstallation removes most of the
      system; don't explicitly remove packages that are taken care of
      by "apt-get autoremove" already. On Buster, removing dpkg-dev
      or make deinstalls python3, gnome-shell and more.
    - Install all "Priority: standard" packages via an explicit
      packages list instead of via --tasks (Closes: #15690). This will
      make it easier to remove some of these packages from the list of
      those that should be installed in the first place, as opposed to
      letting them be installed by tasksel only to uninstall them
      later. I've seeded tails-000-standard.list with the output of:
      tasksel --task-packages standard | sort … run on a clean Buster
      system. Also:
       * live-build forcibly translates --packages-lists="standard"
         into "tasksel install standard", so to make this change
         effective we also need to switch to "--packages-lists
         minimal" or "--packages-lists none". The former has
         problematic side-effects so let's use the latter.
       * Add to tails-common.list some of the packages that were
         previously installed automatically, e.g. via live-build's
         lists/standard → lists/minimal.

  * Test suite
    - Tons of tiny updates for the Stretch → Buster transition, mainly
      updated reference images, but also a few other trivial changes
      (e.g. close with Alt+F4 instead of menu, or vice versa) due to
      changes in applications.
    - Drop test case about migrating from a Jessie-area persistent
      volume. If our code happens to support Tails 2.x → 4.x upgrades
      without going through 3.x, fine. But let's not spend cycles in
      our CI to guarantee this.
    - Revert "Test suite: add backward compatibility with redir <
      3.0." We don't support running the test suite on Jessie anymore.
    - Adjust dhclient listening address for Buster.
    - Bump timeout for poweroff from 3 to 10 minutes (Refs: #16312).
    - Adjust dogtail patterns for gobby test (Closes: #16335). With the
      gobby upgrade from 0.5.0 to 0.6.0 pre-series, the case changed a
      little for a menu item and the window it leads to.
    - Update key shortcut to close seahorse's Preferences window
      (Closes: #16341). The “Close” button is gone from the
      Preferences window in the buster version of the seahorse
      package, making it impossible to close that window. Switch to
      sending ESC instead of Alt-C.
    - Update MAT test case for MAT2 (Closes: #16623).
    - Add debug logging for when we call Sikuli. When following a
      (debug) log live (through `--format debug`) I find this change
      useful to know what is going on *right now* since Sikuli only
      reports what it has done after it is done.
    - Be more careful when finding ASP notifications. For some reason
      both the label and button has a "weird" invisible (despite
      `showingOnly`) twin located just below the Applications
      menu. So let's make some extra effort to actually find the real
      notification, and then look for the label and button among its
      children.
    - Remove obsolete method. Display::take_screenshot() hasn't
      existed for years.
    - Remove workaround "Desktop icons are sometimes not shown" (Refs:
      #13461)
    - Wait longer between search steps in the GNOME Overview. On
      jenkins.lizard — which was under high load at that time — I've
      seen failures while starting GNOME Terminal from the Overview,
      where:
       - The debug log claims we did type "c", waited 1 second, then
         typed "ommandline", then slept another 1 second, then pressed
         Enter. I.e. just as the code says.
       - The video shows that GNOME Shell did pick up "c", which
         selected the first search result ("Configure Persistent
         Volume"), but then there's no trace of typing "ommandline".
         So I suspect that "ommandline" was lost because GNOME Shell
         was still busy, somehow. Let's sleep a bit longer before
         these steps, to give GNOME Shell a better chance to recover
         and notice keyboard input.
    - Log exceptions thrown in generated (i.e. snapshot) steps (Refs:
      #16747). Hopefully this will help us track down these elusive
      exceptions.
    - Extend waiting time for additional software to be installed.
    - Sometimes we need more more time to load a page over tor.
    - Remove useless TailsUpgraderApplyingUpgrade.png. The "progress
      prompt" it was used for just flashes by and can easily be
      missed. There is no reason at all to wait for it since the only
      two final outcomes are success or failure, which we already look
      for.
    - debug_log() when we save/restore snapshots. These actions can
      take a long time (especially saving snapshots on a system under
      load) and can make it appear like if the test suite has gotten
      stuck for those following the debug log.
    - Don't rely on mtimes from Debian packages we download, to
      indicate which one has the biggest version (Closes: #16819).
      These mtimes are copied from the HTTP server where APT downloads
      packages from, which contradicts our assumption that the newest
      file must be the one with the biggest version. Instead we use ls
      to sort by version number, to pick the biggest version.
    - Only send TAB every second to get the syslinux kernel
      command-line (Closes: #16820). Our syslinux has a timeout of 5s so
      sending TAB every second should be enough to guarantee we do
      open the kernel command line. As anonym reported, "the spammer
      makes the splash show for significantly longer: I've seen >10x,
      so the boot splash never managed to appear, which is worrying".
    - Drop workaround to make the TAB spammer compatible with the UEFI
      firmware (Closes: #16820). As reported by anonym on #16820, and
      confirmed by my testing, pressing TAB doesn't seem to open the
      UEFI configuration, so the very reason why we had this
      workaround is gone.

  * Adjustments for Debian 10 (Buster) with no or very little user-visible impact
    - Adjust APT sources and pinning for Buster.
    - Refresh and unfuzzy patches for Buster.
    - Pass --ellipsize to zenity (refs: #16286). This fixes dialog
      width and height on Buster.
    - Update expected /etc/passwd and /etc/group for Buster.
    - Display TopIcons systray on the left of the system menu (Refs:
      #14796).
    - Remove apparmor-adjust-freedesktop-abstraction.diff patch,
      merged upstream in apparmor. The
      9d8b6f4dbd8a04470490ae2bfd52044906abd7f6 commit (first appeared
      upstream in apparmor v2.13.1) implements this change in a
      generic way.
    - Adjust hook to the fact the Dovecot AppArmor profiles are not
      shipped in /etc anymore.
    - Import iuk.git's feature/buster branch at commit 919335e
      (Closes: #16286).
    - Enable desktop-icons gnome-shell extension (Closes: #16283).
    - Add autostart script to have gnome-shell trust desktop icons
      (Closes: #16283). Various conditions must be met for gnome-shell
      to make desktop icons launchable, including file
      permissions. But the GIO metadata::trusted setting is also
      needed, and can apparently only be set from an opened session,
      so let's set the right things with an autostart script.
    - Drop code that sets the cursor to "WATCH" (hourglass) after
      logging in (Closes: #16305) This fixes "GDM's GNOME Shell floods
      the Journal with XFIXES/cursor issues on Buster" by importing
      the relevant bits of greeter:feature/buster's commit abad17b6.
    - Remove 8 development packages that are not part of Tails 3.11 so
      we probably don't need to ship them in Tails 4.0 either (Closes:
      #16272).
    - Completely get rid of Qt4 (Closes: #15182).
    - SSH client: remove obsolete CompressionLevel setting (Closes:
      #16320).
    - Removing /usr/share/live/config/xserver-xorg/intel.ids (Closes:
      #14991). Let's hope the graphics hardware issues we fixed via
      that file is fixed no.
    - Adjust Onion Grater and AppArmor configuration for OnionShare
      1.3 (Closes: #16306).
    - Have OnionShare 1.3 connect to the system Tor via Onion Grater
      for the control port (Closes: #16306). By default, OnionShare
      1.3 will start its own tor process, which can't possibly work on
      Tails.
    - Don't install binutils-* (Closes: #16272). It wasn't in Tails 3.x
      and we have no reason to ship it in 4.0.
    - Install mat2 instead of the transitional mat package.
    - Don't suspend automatically (Closes: #16624)
    - tails-additional-software: Adjust arguments to
      tails-persistence-setup (Closes: #16622). It seems like the perl
      library which previously nicely handled the tps command-line
      arguments now doesn't support taking dashes instead of
      underscores anymore.
    - Start tails-unblock-network in a blocking way (Closes: #16620)
      This reverts commit 59e99c51f15ab9e756e287acb03b4d3a91ca1dd2 in
      greeter.git. NetworkManager starting at the same time as GNOME
      Shell makes things racy: the Wi-Fi password prompt is sometimes
      not displayed (unreproduce on Debian Buster Live).
    - Patch ibus to fix an issue that prevented the on-screen keyboard
      from displaying in Tails Greeter (Closes: #16291).
    - oniongrater: give onioncircuits empty STATUS_SERVER events.
      Connection to STATUS_SERVER events is required by stem 1.7
      connect() function, but we actually don't need them, so let's
      suppress them (Closes: #16626).
    - Fix GNOME bookmarks file for Buster (Closes: #16629).
    - Build VeraCrypt packages with our patches applied for Buster
      (Closes: #16634).
    - Avoid new "render" group stealing a GID we have already
      statically allocated to another group (Closes: #16649) With the
      systemd 241-1~bpo9+1 → 241-3~bpo9+1 upgrade, udev.postinst now
      creates a "render" system group, which shifts GIDs and makes our
      devel branch FTBFS.
    - update-acng-config: add support for 4.x and 5.x, drop 2.x. We
      won't build 2.x releases anymore but we'll start building 4.x
      from this branch soon.
    - Restore Plymouth theme to "text" (Closes: #16743). The default
      theme in Buster ("futureprototype") is Debian-branded and thus
      unsuitable for Tails. Let's revert to the one we use in Tails
      3.x.
    - Stop installing caribou and libcaribou*: they're not used by
      GNOME Shell in Buster anymore (Closes: #16628)
    - Allow read access to /etc/machine-id in the AppArmor profile for
      Thunderbird (Closes: #16756). It breaks access to the D-Bus
      service where the GNOME on-screen keyboard listens on Buster.
    - Fix screen locker not working in Buster (Closes: #16763).
    - Hide lstopo in the Applications menu (Closes: #16797). It's
      pulled as a dependency by aircrack-ng but is probably not useful
      to the vast majority of Tails users.
    - Hide nm-connection-editor in the Applications menu (Closes:
      #16798). We still need the network-manager-gnome package that
      installs this .desktop file (for details, see
      commit:40290be3651eaa6f08346231aef80eddd8b33c64), but there's no
      reason to expose it directly to users.
    - TorStatus: call our custom destructor to avoid a use-after-free
      crashing GNOME Shell (Closes: #16791). It was ported to an ES6
      class in the process.
    - Copy dmidecode to initramfs (Closes: #16857). On Buster,
      partprobe complains if dmidecode is missing. It's not clear what
      the consequences are, at least it doesn't cause partprobe to
      exit with an error status code - but it's cheap to just copy
      dmidecode to the initramfs.
    - Adjust path for webext-ublock-origin 1.19.0+dfsg-2 (Closes:
      #16858).
    - Update Tor Browser AppArmor profile to take into account new
      uBlock installation path (Closes: #16858).
    - Disable the uBlock logger sidebar. This  brings back
      the hack we had before we removed it in #16206. Without this,
      the uBlock logger sidebar is displayed.
    - Reintroduce the same APT pinning as we use in 3.x for uBlock.
      Granted, the version from Buster should probably be sufficient
      right now, but it probably won't be once Tor Browser gets
      updated to a future major Firefox ESR. And in the meantime,
      this pinning discrepancy between devel and feature/buster makes
      it harder to maintain our patch against
      /usr/share/webext/ublock-origin/js/background.js.
    - Drop obsolete libdesktop-notify-perl patches: they were merged
      upstream.
    - Use X.Org in amnesia's GNOME session (Closes: #12213). Since a
      few months gdm3 defaults to Wayland in Debian testing/sid, just
      like upstream. But we're not ready yet.
    - Adjust Greeter's gdm-tails.session for Buster (Closes:
      #12551). This should ultimately be applied in greeter.git, but
      let's deal with it as a patch for now to avoid having to
      maintain two parallel branches of the Greeter.
    - Patch udisks2 and libblockdev and fix Tails Installer to repair
      USB boot on Buster (Closes: #14809).
    - Install gnome-user-docs directly instead of the gnome-user-guide
      transitional package.
    - Install the "crypto" libblockdev plugin (Closes: #14816). It's
      needed by recent udisks to do crypto operations.
    - Use ConditionUser=1000 instead of manually testing the output of
      `id -u' in some of our systemd services.
    - Have debootstrap install gnupg when setting up the chroot.
      Otherwise the build fails after debootstrap has done its job and
      live-build tries to use apt-key.
    - Don't try to install the obsolete gnome-search-tool package.
      It's been removed from testing/sid by its maintainers:
      https://bugs.debian.org/885975
    - Don't try to retrieve syslinux.exe from the syslinux source
      package. Since syslinux 3:6.03+dfsg1-1 this file is (rightfully)
      not included anymore in the Debian source package.  This commit
      is meant to fix the feature/buster ISO build. We of course need
      to find a proper solution, which is what #15178 is about.
    - Drop our pinned AppArmor feature set (Closes: #15149). On current
      Buster the AppArmor package pins to the Linux 4.14.13-1 feature
      set and I expect it'll keep pinning something that should work
      with the policy shipped in Buster.
    - Drop Stretch-specific workaround. This essentially workarounds
      4f8b50afb10a1ce1faf7645971bc020d2eb5d7dd,
      3e2d8a6a025b86f8191d125783ad507c57171bad and
      d56633a3089e5b177e07c2888442745557772f42.
    - Disable the usr.bin.man AppArmor profile. On Buster it breaks
      apparmor.service due to "profile has merged rule with
      conflicting x modifiers" that's most likely caused by the "/**
      mrixwlk" rule vs. our tweaks for aufs support.
    - Import files (from gksu 2.0.2-9+b1) needed for the Root Terminal
      into Git instead of fetching the package and extracting them at
      build time.
    - Use orca's current package name instead of pre-Buster
      transitional one.
    - Stop explicitly installing gstreamer1.0-pulseaudio. This was
      needed on Jessie due to Debian#852870 which was fixed in
      Stretch.
    - Drop adwaita-qt4: it was removed from Debian sid and won't be in
      Buster.
    - Disable man-db.timer on Buster (Closes: #16631)
    - Fix invalid seq range in update-acng-config so we geberate proper
      rules for Tails 4.x and 5.x.

  * Major changes
    - Upgrade Tor Browser to 8.5.5 (Closes: #16692).

  * Security fixes

    - Website: Make sandbox page translatable (Closes: #16873).
    - Website: Only scrub HTML on blueprints (Closes: #16901).
    - Website: Point history & diff URLs to Salsa.

  * Build system
    - Bump APT snapshot of the torproject archive to 2019073103, and drop
      tor-experimental-0.4.0.x-stretch reference (Closes: #16883).
    - Bump APT snapshot of the Debian archive to 2019080801 to get fixed
      firmware packages from sid instead of sticking to those from
      stretch-backports (Closes: #16728).
    - Enable the buster APT repository and install some packages from there:
      hunspell-id, hunspell-tr, and fonts-noto-* (See: #16728).
    - Refresh patch for webext-ublock-origin 1.19.0+dfsg-2, and adjust Tor

tails (3.15) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Major changes
    - Upgrade Tor Browser to 8.5.4 (Closes: #16691).
    - Upgrade Thunderbird to 60.7.2 (Closes: #16834).

  * Security fixes
    - Upgrade Expat to 2.2.0-2+deb9u2 (DSA-4472-1).
    - Upgrade OpenSSL 1.0 to 1.0.2s-1~deb9u1 (DSA-4475-1).
    - Upgrade OpenSSL to 1.1.0k-1~deb9u1 (DSA-4475-1).
    - Upgrade Vim to 2:8.0.0197-4+deb9u3 (DSA-4467-1).

  * Bugfixes
    - Recompute CHS values for the hybrid MBR after first-boot
      repartitioning (Closes: #16389). Some legacy BIOS systems won't boot
      otherwise.
    - Strip debug symbols from the aufs kernel module smaller (refs: #16818).
      The primary target was getting the initramfs down under 32MB, hoping
      to repair boot of feature/buster on MacBookPro 8,1. In any cases,
      the user experience should be improved due to a faster boot for
      every user, and a shortened “black screen” duration (between the
      bootloader and the Plymouth splash screen).

  * Minor improvements and updates
    - Make “Unlock VeraCrypt Volumes” show an error message if locking
      fails (Closes: #15794).
    - Add support for booting Tails from a read only sdcard (fromiso),
      through Heads, allowing for measured boot on some tamper-evident
      hardware (https://github.com/osresearch/heads/issues/581).

  * Build system
    - Patch Thunderbird packages from Debian when building Tails images
      (Closes: #6156).
    - Improve tooling to maintain and update PO files (Closes: #15403),
      rewriting some tools and moving code to the jenkins-tools submodule.
    - Implement preliminary steps needed to make the ikiwiki PO plugin
      able to update PO files for languages that are disabled on the
      website (refs: #15355).

      (Closes: #16802).

 -- Tails developers <tails@boum.org>  Sun, 23 Jun 2019 11:52:49 +0200

tails (3.14.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Security fixes
    - Upgrade Tor Browser to 8.5.2-build1 (Closes: #16824).
    - Upgrade Thunderbird to 60.7.0 (Closes: #16742).
    - Upgraded Linux to 4.19.37-4 (Closes: #16823).

  * Bugfixes
    - Only probe for partitions on the boot device when setting up
      TailsData. Without arguments partprobe will scan all devices,
      and if it encounters a device it doesn't support (e.g. fake
      raid-0 arrays) it will return non-zero, thus aborting Tails'
      partitioning script, resulting in an unbootable install
      (Details: #16389).

  * Minor improvements and updates
    - Upgrade tor to 0.4.0.5-1~d90.stretch+1, the first stable
      candidate in the 0.4.0.x series (Closes: #16687).
    - Completely disable IPv6 except for the loopback interface. We
      attempt to completely block it on the netfilter level but we
      have seen ICMPv6 "leaks" any way (related to Router
      Solicitation, see: #16148) so let's just disable it. We keep
      enabled on the loopback interface since some services depends on
      ::1 being up.
    - create-usb-image-from-iso: Use syslinux from chroot. We used the
      syslinux from the vagrant box before, which caused issues with
      when building Tails/Buster with a Stretch vagrant box and then
      cloning the image via Tails Installer with syslinux from Buster
      (Closes: #16748).
    - Set Tor Browser's homepage to https://tails.boum.org/home/testing/
      if building anything but a stable release. This page explains the
      dangers of using a non-stable release. (Closes: #12003)

  * Build system
    - auto/{build,config}:
      * consistently use fatal() to error out, and prefix its message
        with "E: " to help distinguish them from the noise produced by
        tools we call etc.
      * Similarly, also prefix informational message with "I: ".
      * drop support for GnuPG 1.x.
      * clone more build output to the log file.
      * Drop obsolete check for syslinux version. This version
        requirement is satisfied by Jessie and it is doubtful Tails
        would build in anything older.
      * auto/build: drop a few checks for conditions that are already
        satisfied in the supported build environments.
    - Revert "Build system: try to be smart again by fetching only the
      refs we need." This optimization overrides the trick we have on
      Jenkins (set_origin_base_branch_head in
      jenkins-jobs:macros/builders.yaml),
      that ensures that a reproducibly_build_Tails_ISO_* job builds
      from the commit used by the first build. (Closes: #16730)

  * Test suite
    - Fix mistake with execute() vs spawn() when starting the upgrader.
    - Don't filter during pcap capture, instead let's just apply the
      same filtering when we are inspecting the pcap files. This way
      any pcap file saved on failure will include the full capture,
      and not just the packets sent by the system under testing, which
      sometimes makes it hard to understand what is going on.
    - Also include the content of /var/log/tor/log in $scenario.tor
      when tor failed to bootstrap (refs: #16793)
    - Don't flood the debug logger with tor@default's journal
      contents.
    - Power off system under testing after scenario. Until now we have
      relied on either one of the generated "snapshot restore" steps
      or the "[Given] a computer" step to implicitly stop the old VM
      when we move on to a new scenario. That meant the old VM was
      still running during the new scenarios @Before@ hooks. If the
      new scenario is tagged @check_tor_leaks that means we start its
      sniffer while the old VM is still running, possibly sending
      packets that then affect the new scenario. That would explain
      some myserious "Unexpected connections were made" failures we
      have seen (Closes: #11521).
    - Only accept IP(v6)/ARP during DHCP check.

tails (3.14) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Security fixes
    - Upgrade Linux to 4.19.0-5 from sid (Closes: #16708).
    - Enable all available mitigations for the Microarchitectural Data
      Sampling (MDS) attacks and disable SMT on vulnerable CPUs
      (Closes: #16720).
    - Upgrade Tor Browser to 8.5 (Closes: #16337, #16706).

  * Bugfixes
    - Install Electrum 3.2.3-1 from our custom APT repository (Closes: #16708).
      The version in sid now displays a warning and exits, while 3.2.3-1 is
      still usable, in the rare cases when it manages to connect to the
      network, despite being affected by problematic phishing attacks which
      will only be solved once the package in Debian is updated to a newer
      upstream version.

  * Build system
    - Bump APT snapshot of the 'debian' archive to 2019051601, needed for
      the MDS mitigations.
    - Don't install the firmware-linux and firmware-linux-nonfree
      metapackages, as packages they pulled are already listed explicitly
      and one might run into version-related issues (Closes: #16708).

  * Minor improvements and updates
    - Remove some packages from the Tails image as their use is not
      widespread while consuming space for everyone. They can still be
      installed and upgraded through Additional Software (Closes: #15291).
      This includes: monkeysphere and msva-perl, gobby, hopenpgp-tools,
      keyringer, libgfshare-bin, monkeysign, paperkey, pitivi,
      pdf-redact-tools, pwgen, traverso, and ssss.
    - Fix missing translations in the Greeter (Closes: #13438).
    - Fix missing newline in unlock-veracrypt-volumes (Closes: #16696).
    - Port fillram to Python 3 (Closes: #15845).
    - Enable localization for new locales introduced in Tor Browser 8.5
      (Closes: #16637).
    - Re-introduce TopIcons GNOME Shell extension (Closes: #16709).
    - Improve internationalization of the Unlock VeraCrypt Volumes
      component (Closes: #16602).

  * Test suite
     - Make tails-security-check's SOCKS port test work when there's a live
       security advisory (Closes: #16701).
     - Make terminology more consistent.

tails (3.13.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Major changes
    - Replace all locale-specific fonts and standard X.Org fonts with
      the Noto fonts collection (Closes: #9956).
    - Install localization support packages for all tier-1 supported languages,
      and only those (Closes: #15807). Current tier-1 supported languages are:
      Arabic, German, English, Spanish, Farsi, French, Italian, Portuguese
      (Brazil), Russian, Turkish, Simplified Chinese, Hindi, Indonesian.
    - Disable the TopIcons GNOME Shell extension (Closes: #16608).
      This extension causes crashes (#11188), does not work on Wayland
      (#8309, #12213) so long-term, we need to remove it anyway.
      In order to learn how much our users rely on this extension and
      on OpenPGP Applet, let's disable this extension for one Tails release.
      While TopIcons is disabled (by default):
      · Users can still use OpenPGP Applet via the system tray in the bottom
        left corner of the desktop.
      · Users who do need TopIcons for other reasons can enable it again
        with 1 command line.

  * Security fixes
    - Upgrade Tor Browser to 8.0.9 (Closes: #16694).
    - Upgrade to Debian Stretch 9.9 (Closes: #16670).
    - Upgrade Thunderbird to 60.6.1 (Closes: #16641).

  * Bugfixes
    - Fix Thunderbird account setup wizard (Closes: #16573).
    - Display poweroff and reboot buttons even when locked (Closes: #15640).
    - Disable emergency shutdown during suspend (Closes: #11729).
    - Provide feedback while starting Onion Circuits (Closes: #16350).
    - Associate .key files with Seahorse (Closes: #15213).
      This partially fixes importing OpenPGP keys from GNOME Files.
    - Don't show spurious notification about "TailsData" while setting
      up a persistent volume (Closes: #16632).

  * Minor improvements and updates
    - Add a suspend button to status-menu-helper (Closes: #14556).
    - status-menu-helper: clean up and refactor.
    - Drop CSS hacks for the uBlock log window (Closes: #16206).
    - Polish 04-change-gids-and-uids code style (Closes: #16322).
    - Create persistence.conf backup in a more robust manner (Closes: #16568).
    - Make the WhisperBack .desktop file translatable in Transifex
      (Closes: #6486).

  * Build system
    - Don't fail the build if Tor Browser supports new locales that we don't ship
      a spellchecking dictionary for (#15807).
    - Fix apt-cacher-ng cache shrinking (Closes: #16020).
    - Remove obsolete usr.bin.onioncircuits AppArmor profile (Closes: #12170).
      All Tails current branches now install onioncircuits 0.6-0.0tails1,
      which ships a more current AppArmor profile than the one we
      have in our own Git tree.
    - Install Electrum from sid (Closes: #16642).
    - Avoid new "render" group stealing a GID we have already statically
      allocated to another group (Closes: #16649).

  * Test suite
    - Disable tests about notifications in case of MAC spoofing failure:
      we have a well-known bug here and these tests do nothing but confirm
      it again and again, which brings no value and has a cost (#10774).
    - Clarify what WebM scenarios are fragile (#10442).
    - Avoid zombies by waiting for killed child processes to exit (#14948).

    - Delete all search plugins for the Unsafe Browser (Closes: #15708).
    - Display a deprecation warning when starting Liferea (#11082).
    - Upgrade VirtualBox guest modules to 5.2.16-dfsg-3~bpo9+2.
    - Use Tor Browser for browsing the documentation even when offline
      (Closes: #15720).
    - Provide feedback while Tor Browser, "Tails documentation"
      or "Report an error" are starting (Closes: #15101).
    - WhisperBack: remove the right pane (Closes: #7180).
    - tails-debugging-info: return machine-readable, structured data.
      Adjust WhisperBack accordingly (Closes: #8514). This paves the way
      towards more usable bug reports (#8722).
    - Port lots of our Perl code to more lightweight libraries.
      This decreases the amount of memory used by the persistence
      configuration interface.
    - Do not hide applications that require an admin password (Closes: #11013).
    - Try unlocking every persistent volume when multiple ones are
      available (Closes: #15653).
    - Upgrade Electrum to 3.1.3-1~bpo9+1.
    - Upgrade most firmware to 20180518-1.
    - Upgrade Intel microcode to 3.20180703.2~bpo9+1.
    - Upgrade AMD microcode to 3.20180524.1.

  * Build system
    - Drop AppArmor feature set pinning: this is now done in Debian Stretch
      (Closes: #15341).
    - Remove the now unused deb.torproject.org sid APT source (Closes: #15638).
    - Install OnionShare from our custom APT repo instead of from sid.
      We've mistakenly tracked sid for a while and it has become a problem,
      so stick to the version that works for us until Tails 4.0.
    - Fix building the ISO on zfs by dropping the cache=none setting for
      vmproxy's storage (Closes: #14404).
    - Update the Vagrant basebox for any change under vagrant/.
      Previously, some relevant changes were not effective until something under
      vagrant/definitions/tails-builder/ was changed.
    - Make intltool ignore .py files: `intltool-update --maintain` seems to be
      buggy with .py files.
    - Refresh our CUPS AppArmor profile patch to apply on 2.2.1-8+deb9u2.
    - Make it more obvious that the .orig file check is fatal (Closes: #15727).
    - Delete baseboxes once they're 6 months old instead of 4.
      This is more in line with the delay between our major releases these days.
    - Rename /usr/share/amnesia to /usr/share/tails. It was about time.
    - Abort the build if /etc/{passwd,group} has changed (Closes: #15419).
      Such changes can break Tails after an automatic upgrade was applied
      so let's detect it ASAP. Consequently, ensure a few GIDs — that wanted
      to play musical chairs — are the same as in Tails 3.8 (Closes: #15695).
    - Don't fail the build if the APT lists don't include any package
      whose name matches ^geoclue.

  * Test suite
    - Adjust to the new tails-persistence-setup API.
    - Update the Tor Browser's AppArmor profile name.
    - Re-enable the "I can print the current page […]" test.
    - Update tests wrt. the fact tails-upgrade-frontend-wrapper was ported
      to Python (Closes: #15379).
    - Make a test more robust by waiting for the page to have loaded.
    - Adjust to the fact the WhisperBack debugging info is now configured
      in a machine-readable file.
    - Remove test for tails-debugging-info, that has been a no-op for a while.
    - Adjust for Tor Browser 8.
    - Make the "I open the address" step more robust and accordingly
      stop marking the tests that use it in the Unsafe Browser
      as fragile (refs: #14771).
    - De-duplicate a number of images of standard GTK+ 3 widgets.
    - Make the audio and WebM tests more robust.
    - Make the "I start the Tor Browser in offline mode" step more robust.
    - Make the "AppArmor has (not )? denied" step more robust.
    - Don't try and use XVFB_PID if it's not set (Closes: #15730).
    - Adjust Pidgin test to use a certificate that's still in Debian
      (Closes: #15762).
    - Use a hopefully more reliable public GnuPG key and make tests
      more robust against new subkeys being added (Closes: #15771).
    - Stop hard-coding the list of RTL Tor Browser locales.
    - Fix the "Unsafe Browser can be used in all languages supported in Tails"
      test for locales that have a translated homepage (Closes: #11711).
    - Take into account that apt(8) won't return when run in the remote shell
      with the ASP hooks enabled.

tails (3.5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Security fixes
    - Upgrade amd64-microcode to 3.20171205.1, for the mitigation
      against Spectre (CVE-2017-5715) (Closes: #15148).
    - Upgrade Tor Browser to 7.5-build3 (Closes:  #15197).

    - Upgrade libxml2 to 2.9.4+dfsg1-2.2+deb9u2.

  * Minor improvements
    - Upgrade Linux to 4.14.13, which is the first kernel that has the
      "[x86] microcode/AMD: Add support for fam17h microcode loading"
      commit, that's needed to load the AMD fam17h microcode for
      mitigating the Spectre vulnerability (CVE-2017-5715).

  * Bugfixes
    - Drop Claws Mail persistence setting migration. Whenever
      persistent Claws Mail setting is enabled, this creates an empty
      ~/.icedove/ directory, that prevents Thunderbird from starting
      (Closes: #12734).
    - Don't prevent the GNOME Applications button from opening its menu if
      time syncing resulted in a shift back in time (Closes: #14250).
    - Tails Installer: when cloning Tails to another USB drive, check
      if the target device has enough space *before* any destructive
      actions are made (Closes: #14622).
    - Tor Browser: make "Print to file" work again, for all locales
      (Closes: #13403, #15024).

  * Build system
    - Fix option passed to cmp: -q is not supported but --quiet is.
      Spotted on feature/buster that's the first branch that exercises
      this code, but there's no reason to fix it only there.

  * Test suite
    - Adapt tests for Tor Launcher 0.2.14.3, i.e. the one shipped with
      Tor Browser 7.5 in Tails 3.5 (Closes: #15064).
    - Add support for creating arbitrarily sized partitions.
    - Add a "Try cloning Tails to a too small partition" scenario
      (regression test for #14622).

tails (3.4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Security fixes
    - Install Linux 4.14.0-3 from sid (Closes: #14976). This enables
      the kernel-side mitigations for Meltdown.
    - Upgrade curl to 7.52.1-5+deb9u3.
    - Upgrade enigmail to 2:1.9.9-1~deb9u1.

    - Upgrade sensible-utils to 0.0.9+deb9u1.
    - Upgrade tor to 0.3.1.9-1~d90.stretch+1.

  * Minor improvements
    - Display TopIcons systray on the left of the system menu. This
      fixes #14796 (on Buster, it is displayed in the middle of the
      screen, on the left of the clock) and an annoying UX problem we
      have on Stretch: OpenPGP applet is in the middle of icons that
      share the exact same (modern, GNOME Shell-like) behaviour, which
      is disturbing when opening one of the modern menus and moving
      the mouse left/right to the others, because in the middle one
      icon won't react as expected, and the nice blue bottom border
      continuity is broken.
    - Use the "intel" X.Org driver for integrated graphics in Intel
      i5-7300HQ (Closes: #14990).
    - Enable HashKnownHosts in the OpenSSH client (Closes: #14995).
      Debian enables HashKnownHosts by default via /etc/ssh/ssh_config
      for good reasons, let's not revert to the upstream default.
    - Pin the AppArmor feature set to the Stretch's kernel one. Linux
      4.14 brings new AppArmor mediation features and the policy
      shipped in Stretch may not be ready for it. So let's disable
      these new features to avoid breaking stuff: it's too hard to
      check if all the policy for apps we ship (and that users install
      themselves) has the right rules to cope with these new mediation
      features.

  * Bugfixes
    - Don't delete downloaded debs after install (Closes: #10958).
    - Install xul-ext-ublock-origin from sid to make the dashboard
      work again(Closes: #14993). Thanks to cacahuatl
      <cacahuatl@autistici.org> for the patch!
    - Additional software feature: use debconf priority critical to
      prevent failure when installing packages otherwise requiring
      manual configuration (Closes: #6038)
    - Don't include anything under /lib/live/mount/medium/ in the
      readahead list (Closes: #14964). This fixes the boot time
      regression introduced in Tails 3.3.

  * Build system
    - Display a more helpful error message when the 'origin' remote
      does not point to the official Tails Git repository. This task
      calls git_base_branch_head() which relies on the fact 'origin'
      points to our official repo.
    - Vagrant: never build the wiki early. This has caused several
      issues throughout the years, the lastest instance being the
      reopening of #14933. (Closes: #14933)
    - Install libelf-dev during the time we need it for building DKMS modules.
    - Make the DKMS build hook verbose, and display DKMS modules build
      logs on failure. This hook is a recurring cause of headaches,
      let's simplify debugging.
    - Remove obsolete duplicate build of the virtualbox-guest DKMS
      module.

  * Test suite
    - Log the list of systemd jobs when systemctl is-system-running
      fails (Closes: #14772). Listing the units is not enough: in most
      cases I've seen, is-system-running returns "starting" which
      means the job queue is not empty, and to debug that we need the
      list of jobs.
    - Only support SikuliX; drop support for Sikuli.
    - Disable SPICE clipboard sharing in the guest. It could only mess
      things up, and in fact has confused me by suddenly setting my
      *host's* clipboard to "ATTACK AT DAWN"... :)
    - Decode Base64.decode64 return value appropriately; it returns
      strings encoded in ASCII-8bit.
    - Don't flood the debug logger with the journal contents.
    - Handle case where $vm is undefined during an extremely early
      scenario failure.
    - Allow more time for 'systemctl is-system-running' to
      succeed. (Refs: #14772)
    - Make Sikuli attempt to find replacements on FindFailed by
      employing fuzz, or "lowering the similarity factor". The
      replacements (if found) are saved among the artifacts, and
      serves as potential drop-in-replacements for outdated
      images. The main use case for this is when the font
      configuration in Tails changes, which normally invalidates a
      large part of our images given that our default high similarity
      factor. We also add the `--fuzzy-image-matching` where the
      replacements are used in case of FindFailed, so the tests can
      proceed beyond the first FindFailed. The idea is that a full
      test suite run will produce replacements for potentially *all*
      outdated images.
    - Fix our findAny() vs findfailed_hook. For findAny() it might be
      expected that some images won't be found, so we shouldn't use
      our findfailed_hook, which is about dealing with the situation
      where images need to be updated.
    - Make sure Pidgin's D-Bus policy changes are applied (Closes:
      #15007). Without the HUP there's a race that we sometimes lose.
    - Nump the Unsafe Browser's start page image (Closes: #15006).
    - Hot-plug a 'pcnet' network device instead of 'virtio' on Sid,
      since the latter is not detected on Sid (Closes: #14819).

tails (3.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Major changes
    - Upgrade the base system to the Debian Stretch 9.2 point-release
      which gives us tons of bugfixes (Closes: #14714).
    - Install Linux 4.13.0-1 (Closes: #14789).

  * Security fixes
    - Upgrade Thunderbird to 52.4.0 (Closes: #14963).
    - Upgrade Tor Browser to 7.0.10 (Closes: #14940).
    - Upgrade gdk-pixbuf to 2.36.5-2+deb9u1.0tails1 (Closes: #14729).

  * Minor improvements
    - Upgrade to Tor 0.3.1.8-2~d90.stretch+1, a new stable Tor series.
    - tails-documentation: rewrite in Python + use WebKit for display
      instead of the Tor Browser. Since Tor Browser 7.0.8 rendering of
      local pages (like our docs) fail (#14962) so this is probably a
      temporary workaround of that.
    - Replace the Unsafe Browser's warning pages with static,
      pure-HTML versions. This is truly a *temporary* workaround for
      #14962.
    - Update deb.tails.boum.org APT repo key (Closes: #14927)
    - Refresh Tor Browser AppArmor profile patch to apply on top of
      torbrowser-launcher 0.2.8-4's (Closes: #14923).
    - Drop obsolete manual enabling of AppArmor on the kernel
      command-line: it's now enabled by default, so the (Tails -
      Debian) delta gets smaller. :)

  * Bugfixes
    - Install Tails Installer 5.0.2. Fixes:
      * Most notably, fix an issue preventing Tails Installer from
        installing to drives containing a non-Tails partition that
        (obviously) has affected a lot of users. (Closes: #14755).
      * Fix an issue that made the resulting installations unbootable
        if Tails Installer was using a too recent udisks2, e.g. the
        one currently in Debian Sid (Closes: #14809).
      * Code clean-ups (Closes: #14721, #14722, #14723).
    - Fix UEFI boot for USB sticks installed with Universal USB
      Installer (Closes: #8992).
    - Force Tor Browser and Thunderbird to enable accessibility
      support even if no a11y feature is enabled in GNOME yet (Closes:
      #14752, #9260).
    - Mark our custom Desktop launchers as trusted (Closes: #14793,
      Refs: 14584).
    - Add a systemd --user target for bits of GNOME
      EarlyInitialization managed by systemd, and make the keyboard
      layout configuration as part of it. This fixes an issue where
      the layout chosen in the Greeter sometimes wasn't applied in the
      GNOME session (Closes: #12543).

  * Build system
    - auto/{build,clean,config}: run with `set -eu`.
    - Add script to sanity check the website. Currently it ensures all
      blog posts and security advisories have valid Ikiwiki 'meta
      date' directives, since we depend on it for reproducibility.
      Also make passing this sanity check a pre-condition for building
      the website (Closes: #12726, #14767).
    - Abort the ISO build when DKMS modules were not built.
    - Take into account where DKMS modules get installed nowadays.
    - auto/build: normalize file timestamps in wiki/src before
      building. The copy of the website included in the ISO image has
      "Posted" timestamps that apparently match when we cloned the Git
      repository, which affects reproducibility. (Closes: #14933).
    - Fix reproducibility of builds of topic branches that lag behind
      their base branch with the mergebasebranch build option enabled.
      Two otherwise identical merge commits done at different times
      get different IDs, and we happen to embed in the ISO the ID of
      the commit we're building from. (Closes: #14946)

  * Test suite
    - Bump timeout for "I can save the current page as", otherwise the
      "The Tor Browser directory is usable" scenario fails randomly
      when the system is under load.
    - New scenario: installing Tails to an eligible drive with an
      existing filesystem. This is a regression test for #14755.
    - New scenario: re-installing over an existing Tails installation.

tails (3.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Major changes
    - Upgrade Linux packages to the Debian kernel 4.12.0-2, based on
      mainline Linux 4.12.12 (Closes: #11831, #12732, #14673).

  * Security fixes
    - Upgrade Tor Browser to 7.0.6-build3 (Closes: #14696).
    - Upgrade to Thunderbird 52.3.0 (Closes: #12639).
    - Deny access to Pidgin's D-Bus service (Closes: #14612). That D-Bus
      interface is dangerous because it allows _any_ application running
      as `amnesia' that has access to the session bus to extract
      basically any information from Pidgin and to reconfigure it:
      https://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/DbusHowto
    - Block loading of Bluetooth kernel modules (Closes: #14655) and
      block Bluetooth devices with rfkill (Closes: #14655).
    - Add localhost.localdomain to the hosts file to prevent loopback
      leaks to Tor circuits (Closes: #13574). Thanks to tailshark for
      the patch!

  * Minor improvements
    - Upgrade to Tails Installer 5.0.1 (Closes: #8859, #8860, #12707). This
      version gets rid of the splash screen, detects when Tails is already
      installed on the target device (and then proposes to upgrade),
      and generally improves the UX. It also increases the Tails partition
      size and refuses to install to devices smaller than 8 GB.
    - Deprecate Thunderbird's preferences/0000tails.js (Closes: #12680).
    - Install the BookletImposer PDF imposition toolkit (Closes: #12686).
    - Tor Browser:
      * Fallback to ~/Tor Browser for uploads (Closes: #8917).
      * Silence some common operations that always are denied and
        otherwise would spam the journal (Closes: #14606)
    - Shell library: remove now unused functions (Closes: #12685).
    - Add pppoe to the installed packages (Closes #13463). Thanks to geb
      for the patch!
    - Replace syslinux:i386 with syslinux:amd64 in the ISO9660
      filesystem (Closes: #13513).
    - htpdate: fix date header regexp (Closes: #10495). It seems that
      some servers (sometimes) do not send their headers with first
      letter uppercased, hence a lot of failures to find the date in it.
    - Install aufs-dkms from Debian unstable (Closes: #12732).
    - Install vim-tiny instead of vim-nox (Closes: #12687). On Stretch,
      vim-nox started pulling ruby and rake in the ISO. I think vim-tiny
      would be good enough, and would save a few MiB in the ISO. Those
      who use vim more intensively and want another flavour of vim are
      likely to need persistence anyway, and can thus install a more
      featureful vim with the additional software packages feature.
    - Remove gksu and its and gconf's dependencies (Closes: #12738). We
      use pkexec instead of gksudo. gksu is unmaintained, buggy
      (e.g. #12000), and it is the only reason we ship GConf, which we
      want to remove. The other removals are:
      * libgnomevfs2-extra, which was previously used for SSH/FTP support in
        Nautilus, but isn't needed for that any more.
      * libgnome2-bin which provides gnome-open, which isn't required by
        any application in Tails (as far as we know).
      * Configurations and scripts that become obsolete because of these
        removals.
    - Refresh torbrowser-AppArmor-profile.patch to apply cleanly on top
      of torbrowser-launcher 0.2.8-1 (Closes: #14602).
    - Switch from Florence to GNOME's on-screen keyboard (Closes: #8281)
      and incidentally improve accessibility in GTK+ 2.0 and Qt
      applications. This drops Florence and the corresponding GNOME
      Shell extension.
    - Make ./HACKING.mdwn a symlink again (Closes: #13600).
    - Implement refresh-translations --force .
    - Rework how we handle the individual POT files of our applications.
      Comparing the new temporary POT files we generate with the
      temporary POT files we generated last time (if ever, and if we
      did, for which branch?) is not relevant; these POT files are only
      used for merging into a new tails.pot and *that* one is relevant
      to diff against the old tails.pot.
    - Update the Tails signing key. (Closes: #11747)
    - Reproducibility:
      * Ensure reproducible permissions for /etc/hostname (Closes:
        #13623).
      * Patch desktop-file-utils to make its mimeinfo.cache reproducible
        (Closes: #13439).
      * Patch glib2.0 to make its giomodule.cache reproducible (Closes:
        #13441).
      * Patch gdk-pixbuf to make its loaders.cache reproducible (Closes:
        #13442).
      * Patch gtk2.0 and gtk3.0 to make their immodules.cache
        reproducible (Closes: #13440).
      * Remove GCconf: it is a source of non-determinism in the
        filesystem (element order in /var/lib/gconf/defaults/%gconf-tree-*.xml)
        which made Tails unreproducible.
      * Ignore comment updates in POT files, which was a source of
        non-determinism and therefore prevented Tails from being
        reproducible (Closes: #12641).
    - Kernel hardening:
      * Increase mmap randomization to the maximum supported value
        (Closes: #11840). This improves ASLR effectiveness, and makes
        address-space fragmentation a bit worse.
      * Stop explicitly enabling kaslr: it's enabled by default in
        Debian, and this kernel parameter is not supported anymore.
      * Disable kexec, to make our attack surface a bit smaller.

  * Bugfixes
    - Start Nautilus silently in the background when run as root
      (Closes: #12034). Otherwise, after closing Nautilus one gets the
      prompt back only after 5-15 seconds, which confuses users and makes
      our doc more complicated than it should.
    - Ensure pinentry-gtk2 run by Seahorse has the correct $DISPLAY set
      (Closes: #12733).

  * Build system
    - build-manifest-extra-packages.yml: remove squashfs-tools version
      we don't use anymore (Closes: #12684). Apparently our
      apt-get/debootstrap wrapper tricks are enough to detect the
      version of squashfs-tools we actually install and use.
    - Merge base branch earlier, i.e. in auto/config instead of
      auto/build (Closes: #14459). Previously, a given build from a topic
      branch would mix inconsistent versions of things.
    - Fail builds started before SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH (Closes:
      #12352). Such builds would not be reproducible, and this is an
      assumption (a reasonable one!) that we do all over the place, so
      let's fail early. While we're at it, let's fail if
      SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH is not set as well. Actually we would fail any
      way if that was the case when reaching our
      99-zzzzzz_reproducible-builds-post-processing build hook, but
      let's fail early.

  * Test suite
    - Test the GNOME Root Terminal.
    - Take into account that Tails Installer 5.0.1 refuses to install
      Tails to devices smaller than 8 GiB. It'll still allow *upgrading*
      such sticks though.
    - Use 7200 MiB virtual USB drives when we really mean 8 GiB. In the
      real world, USB sticks labeled "8 GB" can be much smaller, so
      Tails Installer will accept anything that's at least 7200 MiB.
      This commit makes us exercise something closer to what happens in
      the real world, and incidentally it'll save storage space on our
      isotesters and improve test suite performance a bit. :)
    - Have unclutter poll every 0.1s instead of continuously. On current
      sid, virt-viewer eats a full CPU and doesn't do its job when
      "unclutter -idle 0" is running.
    - Adapt tests for Tails Installer 5.0.1.
    - Workaround Pidgin's DBus interface being blocked since we actually
      depend on it for some tests.
    - Test that Pidgin's DBus interface is blocked.
    - Save more data on test suite failures (Refs: #13541):
      * When Tor fails to bootstrap, save Tor logs and chutney nodes
        data.
      * When Htpdate fails to synchronize the clock, save its logs.
      * Always save the systemd journal on failure.
    - When testing emergency shutdown, wait longer for Tails to tell
      us it has finished wiping the memory. The goal here is to help
      us understand whether (Refs: #13462) is a bug in the emergency
      shutdown feature or in our test suite.
    - Restart nautilus-desktop if Desktop icons are not visible
      (Closes: #13461).
    - Test suite: fix assert_raise() when using ruby-test-unit >=
      3.2.5 (Closes: #14654). ruby-test-unit 3.2.5 added native Java
      exception support for JRuby. The fact we defined the :Java
      constant was enough to trigger that JRuby-specific code, which
      failed.
    - Test suite: take into account that click-to-play is not required
      anymore for WebM videos in Tor Browser (Closes: #14586).

      (Closes: #12510).

  * Bugfixes
    - Forcibly set $SSH_AUTH_SOCK before starting GNOME
      Shell. Apparently, due to a race condition, GNOME keyring
      sometimes fails to tell the session manager about the correct
      SSH_AUTH_SOCK, and thus GNOME Terminal hasn't this variable set
      and any ssh process started in there won't use the (perfectly

    - Upgrade Tor Browser to 7.0.1 (Closes: #12635, #12657).
    - Upgrade to a new snapshot of the Debian and Torproject
      APT repositories: respectively 2017060904 and 2017060903
      (Closes: #12609).

  * Minor improvements
    - Tor Browser: enable Electrolysis (e10s), i.e. render content in a separate
      child process, which will allow to improve performance and security
      further along the road. This required us to drop our branding add-on
      and re-implement its functionality in our Tor Browser wrapper
      (Closes: #12569).
    - Clean obsolete cached packages when using the Additional Software Packages
      feature (Closes: #12400).
    - Improve KeePassX database migration handling (Closes: #12375).
    - Upgrade OnionShare to 0.9.2, from Debian sid as it has been removed
      from Stretch (Closes: #12610).
    - Upgrade Tor to 0.3.0.8 (Closes: #12656).
    - Drop obsolete bilibop patch, that was applied in 0.5.2.1.
    - Include disk space usage information in the WhisperBack bug reports.
    - Reorder technical details in WhisperBack bug reports in way that makes
      more sense when reading them.
    - Convert lc.py to Python 3.
    - Simplify some Python code thanks to subprocess.check_ouput.
    - Set the initial keyboard focus on the "Start Tails" button
      in Tails Greeter (Closes: #12509).
    - Convert Tails Greeter's Debian packaging to current best practices.

  * Bugfixes
    - Fix persistent Thunderbird configuration migration when there is
      a mimeTypes.rdf, that doesn't contain any associations to "icedove"
      or "/usr/bin/iceweasel" (Closes: #12580).
    - Fix persistent browser bookmarks, by generating them from an sqlite dump
      (Closes: #12568).
    - Use the "intel" X.Org driver for Intel Atom/Celeron/Pentium Processor
      x5-E8000/J3xxx/N3xxx Integrated Graphics Controller.
    - `exec' from our Thunderbird wrapper so it doesn't remain running.
    - Tails Installer: don't allow installing on non-removable drives
      (Closes: #10731).
    - Fetch the torbrowser-launcher sources from Debian sid:
      it's been removed from Debian testing.
      Refresh torbrowser-AppArmor-profile.patch accordingly.
    - Unsafe Browser: remove the search bar, that's currently buggy
      and its presence only encourages unsupported usage (Closes: #12573).
    - Unsafe Browser: disable searching in the address bar. It can result
      in leaking hostnames and credentials to the default search
      engine operator (Closes: #12540).
    - Make our omni.ja modifications reproducible (Closes: #12620).
    - Generate the fontconfig cache in a reproducible manner (Closes: #12567).
    - Don't include torrents/rss.html in the ISO. It's not generated
      in a deterministic manner and is worthless in the ISO (Closes: #12619).
    - Improve the language → default keyboard layout mapping
      in Tails Greeter (Closes: #12547).
    - Don't close Tails Greeter's main window when Alt-F4 is pressed
      (Closes: #12462).

  * Test suite
    - Run emergency_shutdown.feature after usb_*.feature, to reduce disk
      space requirements (Closes: #12565).
    - Deal with server messages in Pidgin.
    - Improve Pidgin connectivity check robustness.
    - Flag the Synaptic test as fragile (i.e. #12586).
    - Optimization: only test once that Tails, booted on DVD, eventually
      shuts down after wiping memory.
    - Move tests about the shutdown applet to a dedicated feature,
      as they have nothing to do with Tails' "emergency" shutdown feature.
    - Adapt the network connectivity check to Stretch, and improve it to check
      both link and IP connectivity (Closes: #12602).
    - Apply a fix from upstream Git to mutter, to fix some of its interactions
      with dogtail (Closes: #11718).
    - Mark "Scenario: Watching a WebM video" as fragile (i.e. #10442).

  * Build system
    - Set create_box -e, to make the vagrant box generation a bit more robust.
      (Closes: #12578).
    - Install kernel from backports and Tails build deps before performing
      APT upgrade, to avoid useless bandwidth usage (Closes: #12529).
    - Update submodules after merging the base branch (Closes: #12556).
    - Rakefile: fix date comparison in basebox:clean_old (Closes: #12575).
    - Rakefile: have basebox:clean_old delete baseboxes more than 4 months old
      (refs: #12576).
    - Also check for fuzzy patches' .orig files at the end of our build hooks,
      so we detect any fuzzy patches applied by hooks (Closes: #12617).
    - Remove .orig files for patches we allow to be fuzzy.
    - Don't pre-build the wiki when mergebasebranch is enabled.
      When pre-building the wiki, we modify the PO files which results in a
      conflict from the base branch merge in case it modifies the same
      files, which breaks the build (Closes: #12611).
    - Rakefile: add a task that removes all tails-builder-* libvirt volumes
      (Closes: #12599).

tails (3.0~rc1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Major changes
    - Install Thunderbird 1:45.8.0-3+tails2 and handle the Icedove → Thunderbird
      migration, including wrt. persistent data (Closes: #11712, #12242).
      This package also has the patch from
      https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1281959 applied,
      to ease future integration of the Thunderbird AppArmor profile.
      Also, drop the Claws → Icedove migration path.
    - Upgrade to a new snapshot of the Debian and Torproject
      APT repositories: 2017051803 (Closes: #12554).
    - Upgrade Linux packages to the Debian kernel 4.9.0-3, based on
      mainline Linux 4.9.25.
    - Replace the kexec-based memory erasure feature with the Linux kernel's
      memory poisoning (Closes: #12354, #12428). The kexec-based implementation
      was not reliable enough and provided a poor UX. Instead, we now return
      to the initramfs on shutdown and unmount all filesystems there, so their
      content and corresponding caches are erased.
    - Upgrade Tor Browser to 7.0a4 based on Firefox 52.1.1esr (Closes:
      #12115, #12464):
      * Unfortunately e10s (multi-process Firefox) is disabled (#12569).
      * Unfortunately persistent bookmarks created for the first time
        in Tails 3.0~rc1 is broken (#12568).
      * Adds exceptions for the extensions Tails installs on top of
        the vanilla Tor Browser (Closes: #11419).
    - Upgrade tor to 0.3.0.7-1 (Closes: #12485) and log both to the
      usual file and the journal (Closes: #12412).
    - Merge the code that makes Tails almost build reproducibly (Refs:
      #5630); we still have issues with the fontconfig cache (Refs:
      #12567).

  * Minor improvements
    - Add a HACKING document for new code contributors (Closes:
      #12164).
    - Rename tor-controlport-filter to onion-grater (Closes: #12394)
      and import patches killing the delta against Whonix version
      (Closes: #12173).
    - Improve onion-grater; thanks to Joy SN <joysn1980@yahoo.com>
      for the original patches (Closes: #12173):
      · add --listen-interface
      · make stdout/stderr unbuffered to ensure Python exceptions are logged
      · use yaml.safe_load()
    - Improve KeePassX database migration handling (refs: #12375).
    - Electrum: set coin selection strategy to 'Privacy' (Closes: #12177).
    - Allow Onion Circuits to access /proc/pid/status.
    - Make gdm-shell-tails.desktop more similar to the one shipped
      in gnome-shell 3.22.3-3 (refs: #12364).
    - Greeter: have the help window point to updated documentation,
      use WebKit2 instead of the deprecated WebKit, and hide the sidebar
      and banner.
    - Use exec to start KeePassX, i.e. avoid leaving the wrapper running.

  * Bugfixes
    - Install xserver-xorg-legacy, to fix support for various graphics
      adapters that still don't work with rootless X.Org (Closes: #12542).
    - Use the "intel" X.Org driver for Intel Q35 and Intel Atom
      D4xx/D5xx/N4xx/N5xx graphics controllers (refs: #12219).
    - Give UEFI bootloaders upper-case filenames (Closes: #12511).
      Some UEFI firmware, such as the one in the ThinkPad X220, only recognize
      them if they have an upper-case name.
    - KeePassX: enable "Automatically save after each change" again,
      like we did in Tails 2.x (fixes a regression introduced
      in 3.0~beta3).
    - Install packages needed by the "Test speakers" functionality
      (Closes: #12549).
    - Fix automatic upgrades when one is already applied (Closed:
      #12501).
    - When generating the network device blacklist, also blacklist
      network drivers from the staging directory (Closes: #12362).
    - htpdate pool: replace www.sarava.org with leap.se. The former
      has been down for a while and it's not clear when it's going to
      be stable again. The latter should be reliable.

  * Test suite
    - Check that dirmngr used the configured keyserver (Closes: #12371).
    - Sanity check that Chutney starts all nodes in the network.
    - Disable the Sandbox option for all nodes, until Tor#21943
      is fixed (Closes: #12512).
    - Wait for the desktop icons to be displayed in the "Tails desktop is ready"
      step. Let's not try interacting with the desktop earlier.
    - Add tests for memory erasure on "normal" shutdown (refs: #12428).
    - Add tests for memory erasure on "emergency" shutdown, and run some
      with network enabled (refs: #12354).
    - Have eject_cdrom run eject(1) like it used to do in the past.
      Otherwise the machine is immediately halted and we cannot test
      whether memory has been erased.
    - Pass mount_USB_drive structured data instead of free-form text.
    - Test that MAC spoofing and "Disable network" works for
      hotplugged networking devices (Refs: #12362).

  * Build system
    - Generate the Vagrant base box locally as part of the build process,
      instead of downloading it: one less binary blob as input in the build
      process (refs: #12409).
    - Use Vagrant for builds on Jenkins too (Closes: #11972).
    - Tell build script to be more verbose.
    - Respect the 'ARTIFACTS' environment variable if set.
    - Add a second disk to handle the apt-cacher-ng cache, and store
      the corresponding logs in there (Closes: #11979).
    - Use APT snapshots in Vagrant build VMs, create/use a basebox that matches
      the branch/tag/commit being tested, and provision a new VM for each build
      (Closes: #11980, #11981).
    - Ship all build dependencies in the Vagrant basebox, to save some
      time when building ISOs.
    - Make basebox generation compatible with both GnuPG 1.x and 2.x.
    - Set LC_ALL=C, mostly to suppress some warnings.
    - Support forcing VM cleanup before/after build.
    - Add tasks for cleaning up old or all base boxes (refs: #12409).
    - Add build option useful for debugging build failures.
    - Remove obsolete build options.
    - Make auto/scripts/utils.sh more reusable, use it in Rakefile,
      auto/build and setup-tails-builder.
    - Add an option controlling whether to merge the base branch.
    - Add "rake test" target and import logics from puppet-tails'
      wrap_test_suite script.
    - Build Tails as a release simply when HEAD is tagged, i.e. we do not
      require building from a detached head any more.
    - Sanity check compression choice when building a release.
    - Use the host's resolv.conf when building the Vagrant base box.
      Since systemd-networkd is used to manage resolv.conf inside the base box,
      and it hasn't been initialized yet (we are not booting it, just chrooting
      into it) DNS is broken otherwise.
    - Release process: "release" a new base box when freezing.
    - Chown/scp artifacts with a single command to limit overhead and warnings
      noise caused by repeated SSH calls.
    - Add a build options to use a custom CPU model, and custom
      machine type, for reproducibility testing (refs: #12345).
    - Add support for installing Tor Browser nightly builds.

 -- Tails developers <tails@boum.org>  Sat, 20 May 2017 16:48:45 +0200

tails (3.0~beta4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Major changes
    - All changes brought by Tails 2.12.
    - Upgrade to a new snapshot of the Debian and Torproject
      APT repositories (2017041704).

  * Security improvements
    - Enable the buddy page allocator free poisoning (Closes: #12089).
    - Enable slub/slab allocator free poisoning (Closes: #12090).
    - Create IUKs (automatic upgrades) in a reproducible manner
      (Closes: #11974).

  * Minor improvements
    - Firewall: forbid the _apt user to talk to DNS ports. APT works very well
      without DNS access since we only have Onion APT sources, so let's silence
      the logs.
    - Replace Pidgin's "systray" icon with the guifications plugin
      (Closes: #11741). We're trying to remove as much as we can from
      the set of icons managed by TopIcons extension flavours, in the hope
      it's enough to cancel the problems we've seen with them (#10576, #11737).
    - Disable apt-daily.timer, that can only cause problems in our context
      (Closes: #12390).
    - Do not let pppd-dns manage /etc/resolv.conf (Closes: #12401).
    - Ensure rootless X.Org can access /dev/fb0 when started by GDM.
    - Include the amdgpu module in the initramfs (refs: #12218).
    - Tails Greeter: don't mention 'firewall' anymore (#12382).
    - Tails Greeter: avoid the popover menu for Formats being cut,
      in most cases (Closes: #12249).
    - Tails Greeter: disable the screensaver (Closes: #12370).
    - Tails Greeter: fix behavior when pressing Enter in the language selection
      menu (Closes: #12359).

  * Bugfixes
    - Install speech-dispatcher-espeak-ng to fix the Orca screen reader
      (Closes: #12389).
    - Install xserver-xorg-video-intel and use it on a few graphics adapters
      that are not supported correctly by the modesetting driver (refs: #12219).
      More PCI IDs will be added as new affected hardware is reported.

  * Test suite
    - Run on a Q35 2.8 machine (Closes: #11605).
    - Deprecate xtightvncviewer in favor of tigervnc-viewer.
    - Test the Unsafe Browser in 3 random supported languages, not all.
      This should be enough to identify most future regressions in this area,
      and will be much faster than testing them all.
    - Pidgin tests: switch to an image that doesn't depend on the
      topic of tails@conference.riseup.net.
    - Fix a problematic use of try_for.
    - Fix VM.select_virtual_desktop() and VM.do_focus().
    - Random Gherkin improvements.
    - Fix a focus issue for GNOME Terminal vs. Tails Installer.
    - Adjust to kernel memory poisoning being enabled, which breaks the way
      we used to test memory erasure (refs: #12354):
      · Drop "no memory erasure" and "memory erasure" tests, that can't work
        anymore.
      · Test erasure of memory freed by a killed userspace process.
      · Test that memory poisoning applies to unmounted tmpfs.
      · Test that memory poisoning applies to read and write cache
        for unmounted vfat and LUKS-encrypted ext4.
      · Run erase_memory a bit later, it requires less disk space nowadays.

tails (2.12) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Major changes
    - Completely remove I2P. :( We have decided to remove I2P (see
      #11276) due to our failure of finding someone interested in
      maintaining it in Tails (Closes: #12263).
    - Upgrade the Linux kernel to 4.9.13-1~bpo8+1 (Closes: #12122).

  * Security fixes
    - Upgrade Tor Browser to 6.5.2 based on Firefox 45.9. (Closes:
      #12444)
    - Mount a dedicated filesystem on /var/tmp, to mitigate the
      hardlinks permissions open by the user-tmp abstraction. See
      https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/9949#note-23 for details
      (Closes: #12125).
    - Protect against CVE-2017-2636 by disabling the n-hdlc kernel
      module (Closes: #12315).
    - Ensure /etc/resolv.conf is owned by root:root in the SquashFS.
      lb_chroot_resolv will "cp -a" it from the source tree, so it
      inherits its ownership from the whoever cloned the Git
      repository. This has two problems. First, this results in unsafe
      permissions on this file (e.g. a Vagrant build results in the
      'amnesia' user having write access to it).
    - Upgrade libjasper1 to 1.900.1-debian1-2.4+deb8u3
    - Upgrade gstreamer and its plugins to 1.4.4-2+deb8u1.
    - Upgrade eject to 2.1.5+deb1+cvs20081104-13.1+deb8u1.
    - Upgrade imagemagick to 8:6.8.9.9-5+deb8u8.
    - Upgrade pidgin to 2.11.0-0+deb8u2.
    - Upgrade samba to 2:4.2.14+dfsg-0+deb8u5.


  * Minor improvements
    - Don't add the live user to the "audio" group. This should not be
      needed on a modern Linux desktop system anymore (Closes:
      #12209).
    - Install virtualbox-* 5.1.14-dfsg-3~bpo8+1 from our custom APT
      repository (Closes: #12307).
    - Install virtualbox-guest-* from sid. The version currently in
      jessie-backports is not compatible with Linux 4.9, and there's
      basically no chance that it gets updated (the maintainer asked
      for them to be *removed* from jessie-backports) (Closes:
      #12298).
    - Pull ttdnsd from our custom APT repository. It's gone from the
      TorProject one. We removed ttdnsd on feature/stretch already, so
      we'll need to pull it from our custom APT repository only for
      the next 3 months.
    - Clean up libdvd-pkg build files, again.  This cleanup operation
      was mistakenly removed in commit c4e8744 (Closes: #11273).
    - Install gnome-sound-recorder (Closes #10950). Thanks to Austin
      English <austinenglish@gmail.com> for the patch!
    - Stop restarting tor if bootstrapping stalls. It seems tor might
      have fixed the issues we used (see: #10238, #9516) to experience
      with the bootstrap process stalling and requiring a restart to
      kickstart it (Closes: #12411).
    - tor.sh: communicate via the UNIX socket instead of TCP port.
      This makes the library usable when run inside systemd units that
      have `PrivateNetwork=yes` set.
    - Get tor's bootstrap progress via GETINFO instead of log
      grep:ing.
    - Upgrade tor to 0.2.9.10-1~d80.jessie+1

  * Bugfixes
    - mirror-pool-dispatcher: bump maximum expected mirrors.json size
      to 32 KiB. This fixes an error where Tails Upgrader would
      complain with "cannot choose a download server" (Closes:
      #11735).

  * Build system
    - Retry curl and APT operations up to 20 times to make the ISO
      build more robust wrt. unreliable Internet connectivity. Thanks
      to Arnaud <arnaud@preev.io> for the patch!
    - Install ikiwiki from jessie-backports, instead of our patched
      one. Our changes were merged in 3.20161219, and jessie-backports
      now has 3.20170111~bpo8+1 (Closes: #12051).
    - Fix FTBFS when installing a .deb via config/chroot_local-packages
      by being more flexible when matching local packages in the apt
      list file (Closes: #12374). Thanks to Arnaud <arnaud@preev.io>
      for the patch!
    - auto/build: support Stretch's GnuPG v2 keyring filename.

  * Test suite
    - Try possible fix for #11508. IPv6Packet:s' source is accessed by
      `.ipv6_saddr`, not `ip_saddr` (that's for IPv4Packet). So, let's
      just try and see which one of the two each packet has, because
      one of them must be there! Also, given that UDPPacket can be
      either IPv4 or IPv6 it seems safest to try to parse each packet
      as IPv6Packet first -- that way we keep looking at transport
      layer protocols for IPv4 only, and treat everything IPv6 as the
      same, which makes sense, since we should block all IPv6, so
      everything should be treated the same at all times.
    - Changes due to #12411:
      * Raise special exception for Tor bootstrap failures.
      * Remove obsolete debug logging now that we don't log anything
        interesting for `restart-tor` any more.

tails (3.0~beta3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Major new features and changes
    - Make the "Formats" settings in Tails Greeter take effect (Closes: #12079,
      new feature that was broken since it was introduced in 3.0~alpha1).
    - Upgrade to a new snapshot of the Debian and Torproject
      APT repositories (2017031702).

  * Removed features
    - Stop including I2P: we decided (#11276) to remove I2P, due to our failure
      at finding someone to maintain it in Tails (Closes: #12263).

  * Security fixes
    - Upgrade MAT to 0.6.1-4: fixes silent failure of the Nautilus
      contextual menu extension.
    - Ensure /etc/resolv.conf is owned by root:root in the SquashFS
      (Closes: #12343).
    - Protect against CVE-2017-2636 by disabling the n-hdlc kernel module
      (Closes: #12315).

  * Minor improvements
    - Reintroduce the X11 guest utilities for VirtualBox (regression
      introduced in 3.0~beta2).
    - Upgrade X.Org server and the modesetting driver (hopefully helps
      fixing #12219).
    - Automate the migration from KeePassX databases generated on Tails 2.x
      to the format required by KeePassX 2.0.x (Closes: #10956, #12369).
    - Add keyboard shortcuts in Tails Greeter (Closes: #12186, #12063).
    - Install dbus-user-session (regression introduced in 3.0~beta2).
    - Manage temporary directories in a declarative way (tmpfiles.d).
    - Replace references to the /var/run compatibility symlink
      with the canonical /run.
    - Update our Torbirdy patchset to the latest one sent upstream.
    - Install mesa-utils, so that Qt 5 can detect whether software based
      rendering is needed.
    - Have Tails Greeter honor the "debug" kernel command-line option,
      for easier debugging (Closes: #12373).
    - Refactor Tails Greeter to reduce code duplication (Closes: #12247).

  * Bugfixes
    - Fix sizing of zenity dialogs (Closes: #12313, regression introduced
      in 3.0~alpha1).
    - Fix confusing, spurious error messages in command-line applications
      wrapped with torsocks:
      · Ship a /etc/mailname file with content "localhost".
        Otherwise something (Git? libc6?) tries to resolve the "amnesia" host
        name, which fails, and a confusing error message is displayed
        (Closes: #12205, regression introduced in 3.0~alpha1).
      · Have torsocks allow UDP connections to the loopback interface,
        with AllowOutboundLocalhost 2 (Closes: #11736).

  * Test suite
    - Improve debugging info logging for PacketFu parsing issues,
      and implement a plausible fix (refs: #11508).
    - Try to make "double-click on desktop launcher" more reliable.
    - Fix selection of ISO in Tails Installer.
    - Re-enable the GnuPG tests that require a keyserver, pointing them
      to an Onion service we run on Chutney, that redirects all TCP traffic
      to a real, clearnet keyserver (Closes: #12211).
    - Implement a workaround for checking the configured keyserver in GnuPG,
      until a better fix is implemented (refs: #12371).
    - Fix the "Report an Error launcher" scenario in German.

  * Build system
    - Retry curl and APT operations up to 20 times to make the ISO build
      more robust wrt. unreliable Internet connectivity.
      Thanks to Arnaud <arnaud@preev.io> for the patch!
    - Install ikiwiki from jessie-backports, instead of our patched one
      (Closes: #12051).
    - Clean up libdvd-pkg build files, again (Closes: #11273).
    - Rakefile: fix TAILS_OFFLINE_BUILD exported variable name.
    - Adjust apt-mirror to support branches based on feature/stretch
      that don't use frozen APT snapshots.

  * All changes brought by Tails 2.11, except:
    - the test suite changes, that are not all compatible with this branch;
    - the "Tails 3.0 will require a 64-bit processor" notification:
      this advance warning is not useful on a release series
      that's 64-bit only.

  * Major new features and changes
    - Upgrade to a new snapshot of the Debian APT repositories (2017030802),
      and of the Torproject ones (2017030801).
    - Upgrade Linux to 4.9.0-2 (version 4.9.13-1).

  * Minor improvements
    - Improve GNOME Shell Window List styling. (Closes: #12233)

  * Bugfixes
    - Make it possible to start graphical applications in the Root Terminal.
      (part of #12000)

  * Test suite

    - Bump timeout when waiting for 'Tor is ready' notification.
    - Fix the incremental upgrade test.
    - Drop a few obsolete test cases, update a number of images.
    - Adapt firewall leak test to new DHCP source IP address.

tails (2.11) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Security fixes
    - Upgrade Tor Browser to 6.5.1 based on Firefox 45.8. (Closes:
      #12283)
    - Fix CVE-2017-6074 (local root privilege escalation) by disabling
      the 'dccp' module. (Closes: #12280)
    - Disable kernel modules for some uncommon network protocol. These
      are the ones recommended by CIS. (Part of: #6457)
    - Disable modules we blacklist for security reasons. Blacklisted
      (via `blacklist MODULENAME`) modules are only blocked from being
      loaded during the boot process, but are still loadable with an
      explicit `modprobe MODULENAME`, and (worse!) via kernel module
      auto-loading.
    - Upgrade linux-image-4.8.0-0.bpo.2-686-unsigned to 4.8.15-2~bpo8+2.
    - Upgrade bind9 to 1:9.9.5.dfsg-9+deb8u10.
    - Upgrade imagemagick to 8:6.8.9.9-5+deb8u7.

    - Upgrade liblcms2-2 to 2.6-3+deb8u1.
    - Upgrade libxpm4 to 1:3.5.12-0+deb8u1.
    - Upgrade login to 1:4.2-3+deb8u3.
    - Upgrade ntfs-3g to 1:2014.2.15AR.2-1+deb8u3.
    - Upgrade openjdk-7-jre to 7u121-2.6.8-2~deb8u1.
    - Upgrade openssl to 1.0.1t-1+deb8u6.
    - Upgrade tcpdump to 4.9.0-1~deb8u1.
    - Upgrade vim to 2:7.4.488-7+deb8u2.
    - Upgrade libreoffice to 1:4.3.3-2+deb8u6.

  * Minor improvements
    - import-translations: also import PO files for French from
      Transifex. The translation team for French switched to Transifex
      even for our custom programs:
      https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-l10n/2016-November/004312.html
    - Notify the user, if running on a 32-bit processor, that it won't
      be supported in Tails 3.0 anymore. (Closes: #12193)
    - Notify I2P users that I2P will be removed in Tails
      2.12. (Closes: #12271)

  * Bugfixes
    - Disable -proposed-updates at boot time. If a Debian point
      release happens right after a freeze but we have decided to
      enable it before the freeze to get (at least most of) it, then
      we get in the situation where -proposed-updates is enabled in
      the final release, which we don't want. We only want it enabled
      at build time. (Closes: #12169)
    - Ferm: Use the variable when referring to the Live user. The
      firewall will fail to start during early boot otherwise since
      the "amnesia" user hasn't been created yet. (Closes: #12208)
    - Tor Browser: Don't show offline warning when opening local
      documentation. (Closes: #12269)
    - tails-virt-notify-user: use the tails-documentation helper to
      improve UX when one is not connected to Tor yet, and display
      localized doc when available.
    - Fix rare issue causing automatic upgrades to not apply properly
      (Closes: #8449, and hopefully #11839 as well):
      * Allow the tails-install-iuk user to run "/usr/bin/nocache
        /bin/cp *" as root.
      * Install tails-iuk 2.8, which will use nocache for various file
        operations, and sync writes to the installation medium.
    - Install Linux 4.8.15 to prevent GNOME from freezing with Intel
      GM965/GL960 Integrated Graphics. (Closes: #12217, but fixes tons
      of other small bugs)

  * Build system
    - Add 'offline' option, making it possible to build Tails offline
      (if all needed resources are present in your cache). (Closes:
      #12272)

  * Test suite
    - Encapsulate exec_helper's class to not "pollute" the global
      namespace with all our helpers. This is an example of how we can
      work towards #9030.
    - Extend remote shell with *safe* file operations. Now we can
      read/write/append *any* characters without worrying that it will
      do crazy things by being passed through the shell, as was the
      case before.  This commit also:
      * adds some better reporting of errors happening on the server
        side by communicating back the exception thrown.
      * removes the `user` parameter from the VM.file_* methods. They
        were not used, any way, and simply do not feel like they
        fit. I think the only reason we had it initially was because
        it was implemented via the command interface, where a user
        concept makes a lot of sense.
    - debug_log() Dogtail script content on failure.
    - Add a very precise timestamp to each debug_log().
    - Make robust_notification_wait() ensure the applet is closed. In
      robust_notification_wait() when we close the notification
      applet, other windows may change position, creating a racy
      situation for any immediately following action aimed at one such
      window. (Closes: #10381)
    - Fix I2P's Pidgin test. The initial conversation (that determines
      the title of the conversation window) is now made by a different
      IRC service than before.
    - Use lossless compression for the VNC viewer with --view.
      Otherwise the VNC viewer is not a good place to extract test
      suite images from, at least with xtigervncviewer.
    - Add optional pause() notification feature to the test suite. It
      will run a user-configurable arbitrary shell command when
      pause() is called, e.g. on failure when --interactive-debugging
      is used. This is pretty useful when multitasking with long test
      suite runs, so you immediately are notified when a test fails
      (or when you reached a temporary pause() breakpoint).  (Closes:
      #12175)
    - Add the possibility to run Python code in a persistent session
      in the remote shell and use this for Dogtail to significantly
      improve its performance by saving state and reusing it between
      commands. This changes the semantics of the creation of Dogtail
      objects. Previously they just created the code that then would
      be run once an actionable method was called (.wait, .click etc),
      but now it works like in Python, that Dogtail will try to find
      the graphical element upon object creation. (Closes: #12059)
    - Test that we don't ship any -proposed-updates APT sources.
      (Closes: #12169)
    - Make force_new_tor_circuit() respect NEWNYM rate limiting.
    - Add retry magic for lost click when opening Tails' documentation
      from the desktop launcher. (Closes: #12131)

 -- Tails developers <tails@boum.org>  Mon, 06 Mar 2017 17:14:52 +0100

tails (3.0~beta1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * All changes brought by Tails 2.7.1, 2.9.1 and 2.10.

  * Major new features and changes
    - Redesigned Tails Greeter.
    - Upgrade to a new snapshot (2017013002) of the Debian and Torproject
      APT repositories.
    - Upgrade Linux to 4.9.0-1.

  * Security fixes
    - Reject packets sent on the LAN to the NetBIOS name service
      (Closes: #11944).
    - Seahorse: use the Tor OnionBalance hidden service pool,
      which provides transport encryption and authentication of the keyserver.

  * Minor improvements
    - Include adwaita-qt* and enable it by default, so that Qt applications
      integrate nicely into a GNOME environment (Closes: #11790).
    - Add support for the TREZOR hardware wallet in Electrum (Closes: #10964).
    - AppArmor: allow all programs to read /etc/tor/torsocks.conf via
      abstractions/base, to ease maintenance.
    - Don't (try to) bind the Power button to the shutdown action
      (Closes: #12004).
    - Enable natural scrolling (Closes: #11969).
    - Update uBlock Origin patterns + settings file.
    - live-persist: remove Squeeze → Wheezy migration code.
    - Update pre-existing persistent GnuPG configuration on login
      (Closes: #12201).
    - Upgrader: use the alpha channel when the next version will be an
      alpha, beta, or RC. This will allow users of 3.0~betaN to upgrade to
      the next beta or RC, without having to type any command-line
      (Closes: #12206).

  * Bugfixes
    - Fix "upgrade from ISO" when run from a 32-bit system,
      such as Tails 2.x (Closes: #11873).
    - Fix ability to read videos over HTTPS with Totem (Closes: #11963).
    - Re-introduce default directories in $HOME, which fixes
      Spice file transfers (Closes: #11968).
    - Re-enable tap-to-click (Closes: #11993).
    - Lower systemd's DefaultTimeoutStopSec, to get rid of a long delay
      before memory wiping starts. This also prevents shutdown from ever
      being blocked by any buggy service that takes a while to stop
      (Closes: #12061).
    - Drop Jessie APT sources.
    - Re-add VirtualBox DKMS modules.
    - Fix GnuPG communication with keyservers, by using the Tor OnionBalance
      hidden service pool (Closes: #12202).
    - Fix Enigmail communication with keyservers, by teaching Torbirdy
      not to break it (Closes: #11948):
      · Patch Torbirdy to allow not breaking keyserver communication when
        using GnuPG v2.1+, and to use a better default keyserver.
      · Torbirdy: enable the new behaviour made possible by the aforementioned
        patch (extensions.enigmail.already_torified).
      · Torbirdy: drop our custom keyserver configuration, since the
        aforementioned patch makes it the default.

  * Removed features
    - Don't install gnome-system-log anymore (Closes: #12133).
      It's deprecated in GNOME, and mostly useless anyway as it's not
      Journal-aware. It's replacement (gnome-logs) is not usable
      enough in the context of Tails, and most users who can read logs
      should manage to do it with journalctl, so don't install it either.
    - Drop multiarch handling: Tails 3.0 will be amd64-only (Closes: #11961).

  * Build system
    - Disable eatmydata usage and caching: in current Stretch, debootstrap fails
      if we use eatmydata + the operation mode picked by live-build when caching
      is enabled (Closes: #12052).
    - Bump disk space (and memory for in-RAM builds) requirements.
    - Follow replacement of python-reportbug with python3-reportbug.
    - Don't try to deinstall packages that are unknown on Stretch.
    - Move AppArmor aliases to a dedicated file, and include it.
      This will avoid maintaining these settings as a patch.
    - Don't attempt to remove the usr.bin.chromium-browser AppArmor profile:
      it's not shipped in Debian anymore.

  * Test suite
    - Add optional pause() notification (Closes: #12175).
    - Make the remote shell's file operations robust (Closes: #11887).
    - Update a number of test cases for Stretch, sometimes by converting
      them to Dogtail.
    - Drop usage and tests of read-only persistence.
      We won't have this option anymore, and it's not even sure we'll
      reintroduce it (Refs: #12093, Closes: #12055).
    - Adjust CONFIGURED_KEYSERVER_HOSTNAME to match current settings.
    - Test suite: clean up disks between features.

  * Adjustments for Debian 9 (Stretch) with no or very little user-visible impact
    - Adjust dpkg-divert path: it has moved.
    - Replace xfonts-wqy with fonts-wqy-microhei + fonts-wqy-zenhei.
      The former was removed from Debian testing, and the latter are recommended
      by task-chinese-s-desktop and task-chinese-t-desktop.
    - Install virtualbox* from sid.
      It was removed from testing due to https://bugs.debian.org/794466.
    - Drop deprecated settings from org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/power.
    - Update settings name in org/gnome/desktop/peripherals/touchpad, and drop
      deprecated ones.
    - Adjust to changed Liferea's .desktop filename.
    - Also torify Liferea when started via its (new) D-Bus service.
    - Install hunspell-pt-br instead of hunspell-pt-pt.
      Tor Browser 6.5 moved from pt-PT to pt-BR, which is fine vs
      spellcheckers in Jessie since its hunspell-pt provides both -pt and
      -br, but in Stretch they are separate packages.
    - AppArmor: adjust usr.sbin.cupsd profile so it loads successfully
      (Closes: #12116).
    - Migrate from netstat to ss.
    - Update extensions.enigmail.configuredVersion.
    - Remove the jessie-proposed-updates APT sources.

 -- Tails developers <tails@boum.org>  Wed, 01 Feb 2017 19:23:03 +0000

tails (2.10) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Major new features and changes
    - Upgrade the Linux kernel to 4.8.0-0.bpo.2 (Closes: #11886).
    - Install OnionShare from jessie-backports. Also install
      python3-stem from jessie-backports to allow the use of ephemeral
      onion services (Closes: #7870).
    - Completely rewrite tor-controlport-filter. Now we can safely
      support OnionShare, Tor Browser's per-tab circuit view and
      similar.
      * Port to python3.
      * Handle multiple sessions simultaneously.
      * Separate data (filters) from code.
      * Use python3-stem to allow our filter to be a lot more
        oblivious of the control language (Closes: #6788).
      * Allow restricting STREAM events to only those generated by the
        subscribed client application.
      * Allow rewriting commands and responses arbitrarily.
      * Make tor-controlport-filter reusable for others by e.g. making
        it possible to pass the listen port, and Tor control
        cookie/socket paths as arguments (Closes: #6742). We hear
        Whonix plan to use it! :)
    - Upgrade Tor to 0.2.9.9-1~d80.jessie+1, the new stable series
      (Closes: #12012).

  * Security fixes
    - Upgrade Tor Browser to 6.5 based on Firefox 45.7 (Closes: #12159)
    - Upgrade Icedove to 1:45.6.0-1~deb8u1+tail1s.
    - Upgrade bind9-packages to 1:9.9.5.dfsg-9+deb8u9.
    - Upgrade pcscd to 1.8.13-1+deb8u1.
    - Upgrade libgd3 to 2.1.0-5+deb8u8.
    - Upgrade libxml2 to 2.9.1+dfsg1-5+deb8u4.
    - Upgrade tor to 0.2.9.9-1~d80.jessie+1.
    - Upgrade samba-libs to 2:4.2.14+dfsg-0+deb8u2.

  * Minor improvements
    - Enable and use the Debian Jessie proposed-updates APT
      repository, anticipating on the Jessie 8.7 point-release
      (Closes: #12124).
    - Enable the per-tab circuit view in Tor Browser (Closes: #9365).
    - Change syslinux menu entries from "Live" to "Tails" (Closes:
      #11975). Also replace the confusing "failsafe" wording with
      "Troubleshooting Mode" (Closes: #11365).
    - Make OnionCircuits use the filtered control port (Closes:
      #9001).
    - Make  tor-launcher use the filtered control port.
    - Run OnionCircuits directly as the Live user, instead of a
      separate user. This will make it compatible with the Orca screen
      reader (Closes: #11197).
    - Run tor-controlport-filter on port 9051, and the unfiltered one
      on 9052. This simplifies client configurations and assumptions
      made in many applications that use Tor's ControlPort. It's the
      exception that we connect to the unfiltered version, so this
      seems like the more sane approach.
    - Remove tor-arm (Nyx) (Closes: #9811).
    - Remove AddTrust_External_Root.pem from our website CA bundle. We
      now only use Let's Encrypt (Closes: #11811).
    - Configure APT to use Debian's Onion services instead of the
      clearnet ones (Closes: #11556).
    - Replaced AdBlock Plus with uBlock Origin (Closes: #9833). This
      incidentally also makes our filter lists lighter by
      de-duplicating common patterns among the EasyList filters
      (Closes: #6908). Thanks to spriver for this first major code
      contribution!
    - Install OpenPGP Applet 1.0 (and libgtk3-simplelist-perl) from
      Jessie backports (Closes: #11899).
    - Add support for exFAT (Closes: #9659).
    - Disable unprivileged BPF. Since upgrading to kernel 4.6,
      unprivileged users can use the bpf() syscall, which is a
      security concern, even with JIT disabled. So we disable that.
      This feature wasn't available before Linux 4.6, so disabling it
      should not cause any regressions (Closes: #11827).
    - Add and enable AppArmor profiles for OnionCircuits and OnoinShare.
    - Raise the maximum number of loop devices to 32 (Closes: #12065).
    - Drop kernel.dmesg_restrict customization: it's enabled by
      default since 4.8.4-1~exp1 (Closes: #11886).
    - Upgrade Electrum to 2.7.9-1.
    - Make the Electrum proxy configuration apply after upgrading to
      2.7.9-1. These changes incidentally makes Electrum behave nicer:
      users will now not be presented the network configuration part
      of the setup wizard -- a server will be picked randomly, and
      Electrum will auto-connect. The automated test suite is adjusted
      accordingly (Closes: #12140).
    - Remove unused Browser profile seed file localstore.rdf which was
      made obsolete in Firefox 34.
    - Tor Browser: switch from pt-PT to pt-BR langpack. The upstream
      Tor Browser did this in version 6.5 (Refs: #12159).

  * Bugfixes
    - Tails Greeter:
      * use gdm-password instead of gdm-autologin, to fix switching to
        the VT where the desktop session lives on Stretch (Closes:
        #11694)
      * Fix more options scrolledwindow size in Stretch (Closes:
        #11919)
    - Tails Installer: remove unused code warning about missing
      extlinux in Tails Installer (Closes: #11196).
    - Update APT pinning to cover all binary packages built from
      src:mesa so we ensure installing mesa from jessie-backports
      (Closes: #11853).
    - Install xserver-xorg-video-amdgpu. This should help supporting
      newer AMD graphics adapters. (Closes #11850)
    - Fix firewall startup during early boot, by referring to the
      "amnesia" user via its UID (Closes: #7018).
    - Include all amd64-microcodes.
    - refresh-translations: ignore
      config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/doc/tails/website/.
      Otherwise, if the website has been built already, PO tools
      complain that there are files with translatable strings in
      there, which are not listed in POTFILES.in.
    - Make uBlock Origin's button appear on first run. Otherwise it
      will only appear on browser runs after the first one. This bug
      also affected Adblock Plus (Closes: #12145).

  * Build system
    - Be more careful when unmounting the tmpfs used as workspace
      during builds, fixing an issue that made Jenkins' ISO builders
      prone to failures (Closes: #12009).
    - Upgrade the Vagrant basebox to 20170105. The only big change is
      that we now install the backported kernel in the builder VM, to
      make building possible on Debian Sid (Closes: #12081).
    - Ensure the VirtualBox guest DKMS modules are built for the
      kernel we want them for. In some situations, depending on the
      version of the running kernel, the modules would not be built
      for the 686 kernel, which is the one that needs the VirtualBox
      guest modules.  This commit ensures the VirtualBox guest modules
      are built and installed regardless of the how the build
      environment looks like (Closes: #12139).

  * Test suite
    - Replace the filesystem shares support with a helper for easily
      sharing files from the host to the guest using virtual disks
      (Closes: #5571).
    - Do not test sending email when testing POP3. We cannot clean
      that email up (easily) since when we use POP3 deletions won't
      affect the remote inbox, only our local one, resulting in the
      quota being reached eventually (Closes: #12006).
    - Have APT tests configure APT to use non-onion sources. Our test
      suite uses Chutney to create a virtual, private Tor network, and
      thus doesn't support connections to Onion services running in
      the real Tor network (Refs: #11556).
    - Allow connections to Tor's control port during stream isolation
      tests, but only for those applications where we expect that.
    - Fix Electrum tests after upgrading to 2.7.9-1.
    - Make encryption.feature pass for Tails 2.10~rc1.
    - Adapt tests after the Donation campaign was disabled (Refs:
      #12134).
    - Fix 'The "Tails documentation" link on the Desktop works'
      scenario. The TailsOfflineDocHomepage.png image doesn't match
      what we see any more (I have no clue why), so let's use Dogtail
      and solve this once and for all, hopefully.
    - Work around Tails freezing during memory wiping. These
      workarounds should be reverted once #11786 is fixed
      properly. (Refs: #10776, #11786)
    - Support both xtigervncviewer and xtightvncviewer for --view.
      xtightvncviewer is a transitional package in Sid, which depends
      on tigervnc-viewer (which ships xtigervncviewer), so by keeping
      the dep and supporting both binaries, --view will work on both
      Sid and Jessie (Closes: #12129).
    - Test suite: bump image after upgrading to Tor Browser 6.5 (Refs:
      #12159).
    - Add debugging info for when PacketFu misbehaves, and be more
      careful when to save pcap artifacts (Refs: #11508).

 -- Tails developers <tails@boum.org>  Mon, 23 Jan 2017 11:38:37 +0100

tails (2.9.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Security fixes
    - Upgrade Tor Browser to 6.0.8 based on Firefox 45.6. If you pay
      close attention you'll see that we import -build1 but there was
      a -build2. The only change is Tor Button 1.9.5.13 which makes
      some changes to the donation campaign banner in `about:tor`,
      which we safely can skip. (Closes: #12028)
    - Upgrade Icedove to 45.5.1-1~deb8u1+tails1. (Closes: #12029)
    - Upgrade APT-related packages to 1.0.9.8.4.

  * Minor improvements
    - Switch to DuckDuckGo as the default search engine in the tor
      Browser. This is what Tor Browser has, and Disconnect.me (the
      previous default) has been re-directing to DDG for some time,
      which has been confusing users. In addition, we localize the DDG
      user interface for the locales with availablelangpacks. (Closes:
      #11913)
    - Improve the display name for the Wikipedia search plugin.
    - Enable contrib and non-free for our own APT repos.
    - Upgrade Tor to 0.2.8.10. (Closes: #12015)
    - Upgrade obfs4proxy to 0.0.7-1~tpo1.

  * Bugfixes
    - AppArmor Totem profile: add permissions needed to avoid warning
      on startup. (Closes: #11984)
    - Upgrade the VirtualBox Guest additions and modules to version
      5.1.8. This should prevent Xorg from crashing unless the video
      memory for the VMs are significantly bumped. (Closes: #11965)
      Users will still have to enable I/O APIC due to a bug in Linux.
    - Drop unwanted search plugins from the Tor Browser langpacks.
      Otherwise they are only removed from English locales. Note that
      the langpacks contain copies of the English plugins, not
      localized versions, so we actually lose nothing.

  * Test suite
    - Add support for SikuliX, which recently hit Debian Unstable,
      while still supporting Sikuli for Jessie users. (Closes: #11991)
    - Fix some instances where we were trying to use the mouse outside
      of the Sikuli screen.
    - Use "TorBirdy" instead of "amnesia branding" as the "anchor"
      addon.  I.e. the addon that we use to find the other ones. The
      "amnesia branding" addon has been removed, so we must use
      something else. (Fixup: #11906)
    - Dogtailify "the support documentation page opens in Tor Browser"
      step. We previously relied on Sikuli, and the image was made
      outdated thanks to our donation campaign. No more! (Closes:
      #11911)
    - Resolve dl.amnesia.boum.org instead of picking a static address.
      Just hours after updating the dustri.org IP address, its web
      server went down => test suite failures. Let's make this test as
      robust as actually downloading the Tails ISO image -- if that
      fails, we probably have more serious problems on our hands than
      a failing test suite. (Closes: #11960)
    - Switch MAT scenario from testing PDFs to PNGs. Also add
      anti-test and test using using a tool *different* from MAT, the
      tool being tested here. (Closes: #11901)

tails (2.7.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Security fixes
    - Upgrade Tor Browser to 6.0.7 (build3) based on Firefox 45.5.1.
    - Upgrade gstreamer0.10-based packages to 0.10.31-3+nmu4+deb8u2.
    - Upgrade imagemagick-based packages to 8:6.8.9.9-5+deb8u6.
    - Upgrade libicu52 to 52.1-8+deb8u4.
    - Upgrade vim-based packages to 2:7.4.488-7+deb8u1.

  * Minor improvements
    - Reserve 64 MiB for the kernel and 128 MiB for privileged
      processes before the memory is wiped. We hope that this might
      help (but not solve, sadly) some crashes experienced while
      wiping the memory.

  * Build system
    - Make the wiki shipped inside Tails build deterministically
      (Closes: #11966):
      * Enable ikiwiki's "deterministic" option, and require it when
        building.
      * Use our custom backport of discount (2.2.1-1~bpo8+1~0.tails1),
        to fix reproducibility issues (Debian#782315). This can be
        dropped once our ISO builders use Stretch.
      * Install ikiwiki from our builder-jessie APT suite, to make the
        pagestats plugin output deterministic.
    - refresh-translations: don't update PO files unless something
      other than POT-Creation-Date was changed. (Closes: #11967)
    - Fix Vagrant's is_release? check. Per auto/build, we consider it
      a release when we build from detached head, and HEAD is tagged.
    - Enforce `cleanall` when building a release. I.e. don't allow the
      user supplied options to override this behaviour. This is
      important since Vagrant caches wiki builds, and we do not want
      leftovers from a previous builds ending up in a release. Also,
      this is required for making Tails images build reproducibly.
    - Make the build system's `cleanall` option really clean
      everything.  At the moment it doesn't clean the cached wiki
      build (which basically was its only job).
    - import-package: support contrib and non-free sections.

  * Test suite
    - Wait a bit between opening the shutdown applet menu, and
      clicking one of its widgets. (Closes: #11616).
    - Adapt Icedove test after removing the amnesia branding add-on.
      (Closes: #11906)
    - Replace --pause-on-fail with --interactive-debugging. It does
      the same thing, but also offers an interactive Ruby shell, via
      pry, with the Cucumber world context.

 -- Tails developers <tails@boum.org>  Wed, 30 Nov 2016 17:27:37 +0100

tails (3.0~alpha1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Major new features and changes
    - Upgrade to a snapshot of Debian 9 (Stretch) from 2016-11-15.
    - Switch userpace from 32-bit to 64-bit (Closes: #8183), and accordingly:
      · Memory erasure: drop the "one instance of sdmem per 2 GiB of RAM" tweak,
        that is not needed on x86-64.
      · Display a "sorry!" message when trying to boot on a 32-bit BIOS system
        (refs: #11638).
    - Switch GNOME Shell to its default black theme (Closes: #11789).

  * Minor improvements
    - Install the cirrus and modesetting X.Org drivers (Closes: #10962).
    - Install the 'amdgpu' driver for the AMD Radeon cards (refs: #11850).
    - Stop disabling kernel modesetting for QXL (refs: #11518).
    - Replace TopIcons with gnome-shell-extension-top-icons-plus.
      The former causes plenty of trouble and is apparently abandoned
      upstream. The latter is actively maintained upstream, and packaged
      in Debian. (refs: #10576)
    - Use torsocks to torify Git, and drop tsocks entirely. tsocks has been
      unmaintained for years in Debian, and was removed from testing
      for a while (Closes: #10955).
    - Replace Florence's "systray" icon with the Florence Indicator GNOME Shell
      extension (refs: #8312). And then, don't automatically start Florence:
      the Florence Indicator GNOME Shell extension will start it the first time
      one tries to display it. This should save a tiny bit of RAM.
    - Harden AppArmor Totem profiles.
    - Switch to the Debian-packaged aufs kernel module (Closes: #11829).
    - Configure the firewall to not allow root to connect to Tor at all,
      which is possible now that APT uses a dedicated user for network
      operations.
    - Fix firewall startup during early boot, by referring to the "amnesia"
      user via its UID (refs: #7018).
    - Install hunspell dictionaries instead of myspell ones, for a few more
      languages: Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and Russian. Only Farsi keeps
      using a myspell dictionary for now.

  * Removed features
    - Stop installing BookletImposer PDF imposition toolkit.
      It's unmaintained upstream and thus won't be part of Debian Stretch.
    - Stop installing ekeyd:  it's unmaintained, very rarely used, poorly
      designed (dedicated daemon), and security sensitive (Closes: #7687).
    - Stop shipping ttdnsd. It was only useful for developers and power-users
      who can install it themselves as needed. It's been unmaintained upstream
      for many years. It's very buggy so we had to remove it from the DNS
      resolution loop years ago. It's not in Debian. And it's one of the only
      two bits of Tails that still relied on tsocks, that is RC-buggy,
      unmaintained in Debian, and not in Stretch at the moment. So it has
      become clear that the cost of keeping ttdnsd now outweighs the benefits
      it brought (refs: #10959).

  * Build system
    - Bump disk space (and memory for in-RAM builds) requirements.
    - Support new live-config configuration directory naming, again and again.
    - Use the lowest compression level for the SquashFS when compressing it
      with gzip. This makes our development builds faster, and the resulting
      ISO image only a little bit bigger (Closes: #9788).
    - Configure initramfs compression later, to make the build faster.

  * Test suite
    - Various refactoring while we were at it.
    - Port tests to Dogtail: installation, upgrade, notification detection,
      Synaptic, Gobby, and some of Tor Browser.
    - Workaround GNOME Shell being buggy for Dogtail (refs: #11718).
    - Update a bunch of test suite images for Stretch.
    - Mark created disk as temporary when we don't need to keep it around.
    - Simplify adding NetworkManager connections, and rely more on the defaults.
      Not providing the complete configuration file makes us test something
      closer to what happens when a user adds a Wi-Fi connection themselves.
    - Adjust the minimum allowed memory pattern coverage before wiping.
    - Always sync the time from the host when restoring from a snapshot.
      Previously we wouldn't do it when the network was plugged but Tor wasn't
      running, which can cause issues if we *then* start Tor since the time
      may be off.
    - Adjust to the fact that we now support running as a 64-bit guest
      in VirtualBox, and simplify code since we now include a 64-bit userland.
    - Improve how we restart Tor/I2P after restoring from a snapshot.
    - Adjust PolicyKit tests for Stretch.
    - Work around Tails stopping on shut down due to #11730.
      This should be reverted once #11730 is fixed properly.
    - Update the screenshot scenario.
    - Fix pcap file saving on MAC spoofing failure (Closes: #11698).
    - Test that notifications are actually shown.
    - Drop obsolete workaround for Florence sometimes not being hidden
      on startup (#11398).
    - Avoid remote shell deadlock.
    - Install at-spi2-core from Debian Sid.
      With the current version in Stretch, at-spi-bus-launcher crashes on
      start, breaking parts of GNOME's accessibility, and Dogtail.
      For details, see https://bugs.debian.org/840618.
    - Check that the MAC address is spoofed for manually added persistent
      NetworkManager connections created on Jessie and Stretch (refs: #11931).
    - Use nc.traditional in tests that rely on its behaviour.
    - Adjust expected notification text to cope with #11941.

  * Adjustments for Debian 9 (Stretch) with no or very little user-visible impact
    - Adjust APT sources and pinning for Stretch.
    - Don't install gnome-media, which is not part of testing/sid anymore.
      We already install the only bits it was providing or depending on.
    - Don't install gnome-themes: it's gone in Stretch.
    - Stop installing GStreamer 0.10 explicitly: it won't be in Stretch,
      and some bits are gone already.
    - Refresh and unfuzzy patches for Stretch. Replace some of them with
      programmatic patching, as patches break the build whenever
      they become fuzzy.
    - Drop start_AppArmor_earlier.diff: on Stretch, AppArmor starts much earlier
      already.
    - Accept iceweasel-l10n-* that don't provide any search engine:
      on Stretch, at least iceweasel-l10n-ar_1%3a43.0.4-1_all.deb doesn't.
    - Stop deleting 75-persistent-net-generator.rules: obsolete in Stretch.
      It was removed in systemd (220-7).
    - Tell live-boot we're still using aufs: recent live-boot defaults
      to overlayfs, which we don't use yet.
    - Don't remove imagemagick in 11-localize_browser: cups-filters depends on it
      (Closes: #10960).
    - Explicitly install bc: needed by our 2010-pidgin live-config hook.
    - Remove gcc-4.9-base and gcc-5 via a chroot hook, taking into account
      that GCC 5 is the default on Stretch.
    - Switch to openjdk-8-jre: openjdk-7-jre is not in Stretch anymore.
    - gcalctool was renamed to gnome-calculator.
    - Don't try to delete non-existing AppArmor profile for ntpd: it was moved
      to the ntp package in Stretch.
    - Build DKMS modules with GCC 5: Stretch hasn't 4.8 anymore.
    - Don't try to reload or disable an initscript that we don't patch,
      and that doesn't exist anymore.
    - Support the case when /usr/src/libdvd-pkg does not exist.
      Apparently this can happen on Stretch.
    - Adjust to the move of /etc/gnome/defaults.list in Stretch
      (Closes: #11440).
    - Stop installing xserver-xorg-input-vmmouse. It's obsolete and conflicts
      with recent kernels: https://bugs.debian.org/831420
    - Install open-vm-tools from sid: it's been removed from testing.
    - Install the gobby package, instead of the (now gone) transitional
      gobby-0.5 one.
    - apparmor-adjust-tor-profile.diff: drop bits that are useless, and
      prevent Tor from starting, on Stretch.
    - Tor Daemon Status: declare compatibility with GNOME Shell 3.20.
    - Shutdown helper: declare compatibility with GNOME Shell 3.20.
    - Drop 43-adjust_path_to_ibus-unikey_binaries hook: it was a workaround
      for a bug (Debian#714932) that was fixed.
    - Use netcat-openbsd instead of connect-proxy for torifying SSH.
      connect-proxy seems barely maintained in Debian and was removed from
      testing due to https://bugs.debian.org/830423.
    - Don't disable gdomap service: we don't include it anymore.
      unar in Jessie depended on gnustep-base-runtime (that ships gdomap),
      but this is not the case in Stretch anymore.
    - Install system-config-printer-common instead of system-config-printer,
      and drop customization that were needed only for the latter:
      system-config-printer (1.5.7-2) extracts into a new -common package
      the bits needed by gnome-control-center (Closes: #11505).
    - Adjust haveged AppArmor profile to work with Linux 4.x on Stretch.
    - cupsd AppArmor profile: update list of backends, and add aufs-specific
      tweak that Stretch needs (refs: #11699).
    - Revert to GNOME's default font antialiasing/hinting.
      We fixed on rgba/slight when converting some manual fontconfig stuff
      to GNOME's layer on top of it, but at least from a fresh Stretch
      install (2016-08-24) we got grayscale/slight. It could be that some
      auto-detection is involved, so the values would be different depending
      on the actual hardware. Any way, let's try to decrease our delta here.
    - Adjust haveged arguments customization for Stretch (Closes: 11522).
    - Display the date in the desktop top bar, as we did in Jessie and older.
      (Closes: #11696)
    - Drop patch to keep haveged, saned, spice-vdagent and laptop-mode running
      on shutdown. These patches are no-ops on Stretch, where these services
      have native systemd unit files. It's not worth porting these patches:
      saned is socket-activated so in most cases it does not have to be shut
      down, and we expect that the other ones can be stopped pretty quickly.
      Let's bring back this kind of optimization if, and only if, we identify
      an actual problem to fix in this area :)
    - Don't delete downloaded debs after install: apt(8) >= 1.2~exp1 deletes
      them by default, which is not nice for users who use it to preseed
      their persistent APT cache. (Closes: #10958)
    - Hide "OpenJDK Java 8 Policy Tool" from the Applications menu.
    - Don't ship GCC 6: we don't ship compilers in Tails usually.
    - Don't ship gcc-5-base: on Stretch we ship gcc-6-base instead.
    - Don't start shipping libdvdcss2-dbgsym nor paxctld.
    - Adjust default web browser customization: GNOME in Debian now defaults
      to Firefox ESR (refs: #11440).
    - Install libreoffice-gtk3: on Stretch this is needed to have Gtk+ 3 widgets
      and a Gtk/GNOMEish print dialog.
    - Explicitly install gtk2-engines-pixbuf, as it's not pulled automatically
      on Stretch, and it's needed to theme GTK+ 2 applications in a nice way
      (Closes: #11715).
    - AppArmor gnome abstraction: allow reading /etc/xdg/*-mimeapps.list
      (refs: #11440).
    - Drop obsolete disabling of GNOME Keyring's GnuPG agent feature.
      That feature was removed upstream.
    - Explicitly select pinentry-gtk2 as our preferred pinentry program.
      On Stretch, gnome-keyring depends on pinentry-gnome3, and then that one
      is selected by default. It does not feel worth it to introduce a hackish
      solution such as a fake pinentry-gnome3 package, so let's ignore it and
      just make sure we are using the pinentry program we prefer
      (Closes: #11713).
    - Drop keep_memlockd_on_shutdown.diff: it's been a no-op since Tails 2.0
      (Closes: #11708).
    - Drop custom NetworkManager plugin configuration: these tweaks are not
      needed on Stretch anymore.
    - Disable new style network interface naming scheme.
      It has little value for a live system, so let's stick to what we are
      used to, and avoid having to adjust code/config/test suite
      (Closes: #11721).
    - Drop obsolete NM configuration wrt. sending hostname in DHCP requests
      (Closes: #11720).
    - Update APT pinning to cover all binary packages built from src:mesa
      (refs: #11853).
    - Don't try to install gnupg-curl: it doesn't exist anymore in Stretch.
    - Install seahorse-nautilus from sid. It's been removed from testing.
    - Drop workaround for Debian bug #645466, that was fixed in 2014
      (Closes: #11534).
    - Allow the "_apt" user to use Tor: in Stretch, APT network operations
      are performed with the "_apt" user and not root.
    - Make sure that 'localhost' points to the IPv4 loopback address.
    - Make desktop launchers executable (Closes: #11927).
    - Disable Wayland usage in GDM (Closes: #11923).
    - Fix AppArmor profile for gst-plugin-scanner (Closes: #11928).
    - Change Nautilus' default zoom level to 'small' (Closes: #11716).
      The icons in GNOME Files and on the desktop are too huge otherwise. With
      this new setting, they are similar in size to what we had in Jessie.
    - Fix broken symlink preventing Enigmail from being enabled.
    - Configure NetworkManager to not touch MAC addresses (refs: #11931).
      Its default behaviour on Debian Stretch is to reset the MAC address to the
      permanent one, and we did not make up our mind yet wrt. replacing
      our custom MAC spoofing system with NM's own one (refs: #11293).
    - Patch NetworkManager so that it does not leak the hostname in DHCP
      requests (Closes: #11720).
    - Deal with the fact that the NetworkManager dispatcher scripts are now
      sometimes called with an empty first argument (Closes: #11938).
    - Upgrade to GnuPG 2.1.15-9, and accordingly:
      · Remove the CA certificate for sks-keyservers.net, that we installed
        in the system-wide CAs directory: it is now included in the dirmngr
        package. Stop trusting it for non-GnuPG operations.
      · Make dirmngr use the sks-keyservers.net CA certificate from Debian.
      · Move keyserver proxy configuration to dirmngr.conf, and drop the
        keyserver-options that are obsolete or now the default.

 -- Tails developers <tails@boum.org>  Sun, 13 Nov 2016 14:46:04 +0100

tails (2.6) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Major new features and changes
    - Install Tor 0.2.8.7. (Closes: #11351)
    - Enable kASLR in the Linux kernel. (Closes: #11281)
    - Upgrade Icedove to 1:45.2.0-1~deb8u1+tails1: (Closes: #11714)
      · Drop auto-fetched configurations using Oauth2.  They do not
        work together with Torbirdy since it disables needed
        functionality (like JavaScript and cookies) in the embedded
        browser. This should make auto-configuration work for GMail
        again, for instance.  (Closes: ##11536)
      · Pin Icedove to be installed from our APT repo. Debian's
        Icedove packages still do not have our secure Icedove
        autoconfig wizard patches applied, so installing them would be
        a serious security regression. (Closes: #11613)
      · Add missing icedove-l10n-* packages to our custom APT
        repository (Closes: #11550)
    - Upgrade to Linux 4.6: (Closes: #10298)
      · Install the 686 kernel flavour instead of the obsolete 586
        one.
      · APT, dpkg: add amd64 architecture. The amd64 kernel flavour is
        not built anymore for the i386 architecture, so we need to use
        multiarch now.
      · Build and install the out-of-tree aufs4 module. (Closes: #10298)
      · Disable kernel modesetting for QXL: it's not compatible with
        Jessie's QXL X.Org driver.

  * Security fixes
    - Hopefully fixed an issue which would sometimes make the Greeter
      ignore the "disable networking" or "bridge mode"
      options. (Closes: #11593)

  * Minor improvements
    - Install firmware-intel-sound and firmware-ti-connectivity.  This
      adds support for some sound cards and Wi-Fi adapters.  (Closes:
      #11502)
    - Install OpenPGP Applet from Debian. (Closes: #10190)
    - Port the "About Tails" dialog to python3.
    - Run our initramfs memory erasure hook earlier (Closes:
      #10733). The goal here is to:
      · save a few seconds on shutdown (it might matter especially for
        the emergency one);
      · work in a less heavily multitasking / event-driven
        environment, for more robust operation.
    - Install rngd, and make rng-tools initscript return success when
      it can't find any hardware RNG device. Most Tails systems around
      probably have no such device, and we don't want systemd to
      believe they failed to boot properly. (Closes: #5650)
    - Don't force using the vboxvideo X.Org driver. According to our
      tests, this forced setting is:
       · harmful: it breaks X startup when the vboxvideo *kernel*
         driver is loaded;
       · useless: X.Org now autodetects the vboxvideo X.Org driver and
         uses it when running in VirtualBox and the vboxvideo kernel
         is not present.
    - Port boot-profile to python3 (Closes: #10083). Thanks to
      heartsucker <heartsucker@autistici.org> for the patch!
    - Include /proc/cmdline and the content of persistent APT sources
      in WhisperBack bug reports. (Closes: #11675, #11635)
    - Disable non-free APT sources at boot time. (Closes: #10130)
    - Have a dedicated page for the homepage of Tor Browser in
      Tails. (Closes: # 11725)
    - Only build the VirtualBox kernel modules for the 32-bit kernel.
      It's both hard and useless to build it for 64-bit in the current
      state of things, as long as we're shipping a 32-bit userspace.
      Also, install virtualbox-* from jessie-backports, since the
      version in Jessie is not compatible with Linux 4.x.

  * Build system
    - Don't install+remove dpatch during the build. It's not been
      needed in this hook for ages.
    - Bump BUILD_SPACE_REQUIREMENT: at least one of us needed that to
      build feature/10298-linux-4.x-aufs with the gzipcomp option.

  * Test suite
    - Send Tails Installer's debug log to the Cucumber debug log on
      failure. This is meant to debug #10720 since I can't
      reproduce it locally.
    - Give the system under testing 2 vCPUs. (Closes: #6729)
    - Split scenarios from checks.feature. (Closes: #5707)
    - Add retry-logic to the Synaptic tests. (Closes: #10412, #10441,
      #10991)
    - Run usb_upgrade.feature earlier, when there is enough free disk
      space left. (Closes: #11582)
    - Use more recent virtual hardware in the system under test,
      i.e. USB 3.0 (nec-xhci) on a pc-i440fx-2.5 machine. Switching
      USB controllers has helped with problems we see on Jenkins when
      booting from USB (#11588). Also, there are chances that more
      recent virtual hardware sees more testing these days, so it
      sounds potentially useful to "upgrade".
    - Add support for Cucumber 2.4. (Closes: #11690)
    - Always write {pretty,debug} logs and JSON output to the artifact
      directory.
    - Disable info level logging on Chutney nodes to save disk
      space. For our network all these add up to > 1 GiB and we didn't
      take this into account when budgeting RAM to the isotesters on
      Jenkins.

  * Bugfixes
    - Enable Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery for IPv4. If any
      system on the path to the remote host has a MTU smaller than the
      standard Ethernet one, then Tails will receive an ICMP packet
      asking it to send smaller packets. Our firewall will drop such
      ICMP packets to the floor, and then the TCP connection won't
      work properly. This can happen to any TCP connection, but so far
      it's been reported as breaking obfs4 for actual users. Thanks to
      Yawning for the help! (Closes: #9268)
    - Make Tails Upgrader ship other locales than English. (Closes:
      #10221)
    - Make it possible to add local USB printers again. Bugfix on
      Tails 2.0. (Closes #10965).

  * Minor improvements
    - Remove custom SSH ciphers and MACs settings. (Closes: #7315)
    - Bring back "minimize" and "maximize" buttons in titlebars by
      default. (Closes: #11270)
    - Icedove improvements:
      * Stop patching in our default into Torbirdy. We've upstreamed
        some parts, and the rest we set with pref branch overrides in
        /etc/xul-ext/torbirdy.js. (Closes: #10905)
      * Use hkps keyserver in Enigmail. (Closes: #10906)
      * Default to POP if persistence is enabled, IMAP is
        not. (Closes: #10574)
      * Disable remote email account creation in Icedove. (Closes:
        #10464)
    - Firewall hardening (Closes: #11391):
      * Don't accept RELATED packets. This enables quite a lot of code
        in the kernel that we don't need. Let's reduce the attack
        surface a bit.
      * Restrict debian-tor user to NEW TCP syn packets. It doesn't
        need to do more, so let's do a little bit of security in
        depth.
      * Disable netfilter's nf_conntrack_helper.
      * Fix disabling of automatic conntrack helper assignment.
    - Kernel hardening:
      * Set various kernel boot options: slab_nomerge slub_debug=FZ
        mce=0 vsyscall=none. (Closes: #11143)
      * Remove the kernel .map files. These are only useful for kernel
        debugging and slightly make things easier for malware, perhaps
        and otherwise just occupy disk space. Also stop exposing
        kernel memory addresses through /proc etc. (Closes: #10951)
    - Drop zenity hacks to "focus" the negative answer. Jessie's
      zenity introduced the --default-cancel option, finally!
      (Closes: #11229)
    - Drop useless APT pinning for Linux.
    - Remove gnome-tweak-tool. (Closes: #11237)
    - Install python-dogtail, to enable accessibility technologies in
      our automated test suite (see below). (Part of: #10721)
    - Install libdrm and mesa from jessie-backports. (Closes: #11303)
    - Remove hledger. (Closes: #11346)
    - Don't pre-configure the #tails chan on the default OFTC account.
      (Part of: #11306)
    - Install onioncircuits from jessie-backports. (Closes: #11443)
    - Remove nmh. (Closes: #10477)
    - Drop Debian experimental APT source: we don't use it.
    - Use APT codenames (e.g. "stretch") instead of suites, to be
      compatible with our tagged APT snapshots.
    - Drop module-assistant hook and its cleanup. We've not been using
      it since 2010.
    - Remove 'Reboot' and 'Power Off' entries from Applications →
      System Tools. (Closes: #11075)
    - Pin our custom APT repo to the same level as Debian ones, and
      explicitly pin higher the packages we want to pull from our custom
      APT repo, when needed.
    - config/chroot_local-hooks/59-libdvd-pkg: verify libdvdcss
      package installation. (Closes: #11420)
    - Make Tails Upgrader use our new mirror pool design. (Closes:
      #11123)
    - Drop custom OpenSSH client ciphers and MACs settings. We did a
      pretty bad job at maintaining them compared to the Debian
      upstream. (Closes: #7315)
    - Install jessie-backports version of all binary packages built
      from src:hplip. This adds support for quite a few new
      printers.
    - Install printer-driver-postscript-hp, which adds support for
      some more printers.

  * Build system
    - Use a freezable APT repo when building Tails. This is a first
      step towards reproducible builds, and improves our QA and
      development processes by making our builds more predictable. For
      details, see: https://tails.boum.org/contribute/APT_repository/
    - There has been a massive amount of improvements to the
      Vagrant-based build system, and now it could be considered the
      de-facto build system for Tails! Improvements and fixes include:
      * Migrate Vagrant to use libvirt/KVM instead of
        Virtualbox. (Closes: #6354)
      * Make apt-get stuff non-interactive while provisioning.
        Because there is no interaction, so that will results in
        errors.
      * Bump disk space (=> RAM for RAM builds) needed to build with
        Vagrant. Since the Jessie migration it seems impossible to
        keep this low enough to fit in 8 GiB or RAM. For this reason
        we also drop the space optimization where we build inside a
        crazy aufs stack; now we just build in a tmpfs.
      * Clean up apt-cacher-ng cache on vm:provision to save disk
        space on the builder.
      * Add convenient Rake task for SSH:ing into the builder VM:
        `rake vm:ssh`.
      * Add rake task for generating a new Vagrant base box.
      * Automatically provision the VM on build to keep things up-to-date.
      * Don't enable extproxy unless explicitly given as an
        option. Previously it would automatically be enabled when
        `http_proxy` is set in the environment, unlike what is
        documented. This will hopefully lead to fewer surprises for users
        who e.g. point http_proxy to a torified polipo, or similar.
      * Re-fetch tags when running build-tails with Vagrant. That
        should fix an annoyance related to #7182 that I frequently
        encounter: when I, as the RM, rebuild the release image the
        second time from the force-updated tag, the build system would
        not have the force-updated tag. (Closes: #7182)
      * Make sure we use the intended locale in the Tails builder VM.
        Since we communicate via SSH, and e.g. Debian forward the
        locale env vars by default, we have to take some steps
        ensuring we do not do that.
    - Pull monkeysphere from stretch to avoid failing to install under
      eatmydata. Patch submitted by Cyril Brulebois <cyril@debamax.com>.

  * Test suite
    - Add wrapper around dogtail (inside Tails) for "remote" usage in
      the automated test suite. This provides a simple interface for
      generating dogtail python code, sending it to the guest, and
      executing it, and should allow us to write more robust tests
      leveraging assistive technologies. (Closes: #10721)
    - A few previously sikuli-based tests has been migrated to use
      dogtail instead, e.g. GNOME Applications menu interaction.
    - Add a test for re-configuring an existing persistent volume.
      This is a regression test for #10809. (Closes: #10834)
    - Use a simulated Tor network provided by Chutney in the automated
      test suite. The main motivation here is improved robustness --
      since the "Tor network" we now use will exit from the host
      running the automated test suite, we won't have to deal with Tor
      network blocking, or unreliable circuits. Performance should
      also be improved. (Closes: #9521)
    - Drop the usage of Tor Check in our tests. It doesn't make sense
      now when we use Chutney since that always means it will report
      that Tor is not being used.
    - Stop testing obsolete pluggable transports.
    - Completely rewrite the firewall leak detector to something more
      flexible and expressive.
    - Run tcpdump with --immediate-mode for the network sniffer. With
      this option, "packets are delivered to tcpdump as soon as they
      arrive, rather than being buffered for efficiency" which is
      required to make the sniffing work reliable the way we use it.
    - Remove most scenarios testing "tordate". It just isn't working
      well in Tails, so we shouldn't expect the tests to actually work
      all of the time. (Closes: #10440)
    - Close Pidgin before we inspect or persist its accounts.xml.
      I've seen a case when that file is _not_ saved (and thus, not
      persisted) if we shut down the system while Pidgin is still
      running. (Closes: #11413)
    - Close the GNOME Notification bar by pressing ESC, instead of
      opening the Applications menu. The Applications menu often
      covers other elements that we're looking for on the
      screen. (Closes #11401)
    - Hide Florence keyboard window when it doesn't vanish by itself
      (Closes: #11398) and wait a bit less for Florence to disappear
      (Closes: #11464).

    - Umount and clean up leftover temporary directories from old
      builds. (Closes: #10772)

tails (2.0.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Major new features and changes
    - Enable the Tor Browser's font fingerprinting protection
      (Closes: #11000). We do it for all browsers (including
      the Unsafe Browser and I2P Browser mainly to avoid making our
      automated test suite overly complex. This implied to set an appropriate
      working directory when launching the Tor Browser, to accommodate for
      the assumptions it makes about this.

  * Security fixes
    - Upgrade Tor Browser to 5.5.2 (Closes: #11105).

  * Bugfixes
    - Repair 32-bit UEFI support (Closes: #11007); bugfix on 2.0.
    - Add libgnome2-bin to installed packages list to provide gnome-open,
      which fixes URL handling at least in KeePassX, Electrum and Icedove
      (Closes: #11031); bugfix on 2.0. Thanks to segfault for the patch!

  * Minor improvements
    - Refactor and de-duplicate the chrooted browsers' configuration:
      prefs.js, userChrome.css (Closes: #9896).
    - Make the -profile Tor Launcher workaround simpler (Closes: #7943).
    - Move Torbutton environment configuration to the tor-browser script,
      instead of polluting the default system environment with it.
    - Refresh patch against the Tor Browser AppArmor profile
      (Closes: #11078).
    - Propagate Tor Launcher options via the wrapper.
    - Move tor-launcher script to /usr/local/bin.
    - Move tor-launcher-standalone to /usr/local/lib.
    - Move Tor Launcher env configuration closer to the place where it is used,
      for simplicity's sake.

  * Test suite
    - Mass update browser and Tor Launcher related images due to font change,
      caused by Tor Browser 5.5's font fingerprinting protection
      (Closes: #11097). And then, use separate PrintToFile.png for the browsers,
      and Evince, since it cannot be shared anymore.
    - Adjust to the refactored chrooted browsers configuration handling.
    - Test that Tor Launcher uses the correct Tor Browser libraries.
    - Allow more slack when verifying that the date that was set.
    - Bump a bit the timeout used when waiting for the remote shell.
    - Bump timeout for the process to disappear, when closing Evince.
    - Bump timeout when saving persistence configuration.
    - Bump timeout for bootstrapping I2P.

  * Build system
    - Remove no longer relevant places.sqlite cleanup procedure.

tails (2.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Major new features and changes
    - Upgrade to Debian 8 (Jessie).
    - Migrate to GNOME Shell in Classic mode.
    - Use systemd as PID 1, and convert all custom initscripts to systemd units.
    - Remove the Windows camouflage feature: our call for help to port
      it to GNOME Shell (issued in January, 2015) was unsuccessful.
    - Remove Claws Mail: Icedove is now the default email client
      (Closes: #10167).
    - Upgrade Tor Browser to 5.5 (Closes: #10858, #10983).

  * Security fixes
    - Minimally sandbox many services with systemd's namespacing features.
    - Upgrade Linux to 3.16.7-ckt20-1+deb8u3.
    - Upgrade Git to 1:2.1.4-2.1+deb8u1.
    - Upgrade Perl to 5.20.2-3+deb8u3.
    - Upgrade bind9-related packages to 1:9.9.5.dfsg-9+deb8u5.
    - Upgrade FUSE to 2.9.3-15+deb8u2.
    - Upgrade isc-dhcp-client tot 4.3.1-6+deb8u2.
    - Upgrade libpng12-0 to 1.2.50-2+deb8u2.
    - Upgrade OpenSSH client to 1:6.7p1-5+deb8u1.

  * Bugfixes
    - Restore the logo in the "About Tails" dialog.
    - Don't tell the user that "Tor is ready" before htpdate is done
      (Closes: #7721).
    - Upgrader wrapper: make the check for free memory more accurate
      (Closes: #10540, #8263).
    - Allow the desktop user, when active, to configure printers;
      fixes regression introduced in Tails 1.1 (Closes: #8443).
    - Close Vidalia before we restart Tor. Otherwise Vidalia will be running
      and showing errors while we make sure that Tor bootstraps, which could
      take a while.
    - Allow Totem to read DVDs, by installing apparmor-profiles-extra
      from jessie-backports (Closes: #9990).
    - Make memory erasure on shutdown more robust (Closes: #9707, #10487):
      · don't forcefully overcommit memory
      · don't kill the allocating task
      · make sure the kernel doesn't starve from memory
      · make parallel sdmem handling faster and more robust
    - Don't offer the option, in Tor Browser, to open a downloaded file with
      an external application (Closes: #9285). Our AppArmor confinement was
      blocking most such actions anyway, resulting in poor UX; bugfix on 1.3.
      Accordingly, remove the now-obsolete exception we had in the Tor
      Browser AppArmor profile, that allowed executing seahorse-tool.
    - Fix performance issue in Tails Upgrader, that made it very slow to apply
      an automatic upgrade; bugfix on 1.7 (Closes: #10757).
    - Use our wrapper script to start Icedove from the GNOME menus.
    - Make it possible to localize our Icedove wrapper script.
    - List Icedove persistence option in the same position where Claws Mail
      used to be, in the persistent volume assistant (Closes: #10832).
    - Fix Electrum by installing the version from Debian Testing
      (Closes: #10754). We need version >=2.5.4-2, see #9713;
      bugfix on 2.0~beta1. And, explicitly install python-qt4 to enable
      Electrum's GUI: it's a Recommends, and we're not pulling it ourselves
      via other means anymore.
    - Restore default file associations (Closes: #10798);
      bugfix on 2.0~beta1.
    - Update 'nopersistent' boot parameter to 'nopersistence'; bugfix on 0.12
      (Closes: #10831). Thanks to live-media=removable, this had no security
      impact in practice.
    - Repair dotfiles persistence feature, by adding a symlink from
      /lib/live/mount/persistence to /live/persistence; bugfix on 2.0~beta1
      (Closes: #10784).
    - Fix ability to re-configure an existing persistent volume using
      the GUI; bugfix on 2.0~beta1 (Closes: #10809).
    - Associate armored OpenPGP public keys named *.key with Seahorse,
      to workaround https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=93656;
      bugfix on 1.1 (Closes: #10889).
    - Update the list of enabled GNOME Shell extensions, which might fix
      the "GNOME Shell sometimes leaves Classic mode" bug seen in 2.0~beta1:
      · Remove obsolete "Alternative Status Menu", that is not shipped
        in Debian anymore.
      · Explicitly enable the GNOME Shell extensions that build
        the Classic mode.
    - Make _get_tg_setting() compatible with set -u (Closes: #10785).
    - laptop-mode-tools: don't control autosuspend. Some USB input
      devices don't support autosuspend. This change might help fix
      #10850, but even if it doesn't, it makes sense to me that we
      don't let laptop-mode-tools fiddle with this on a Live system
      (Closes (for now): #10850).

  * Minor improvements
    - Remove obsolete code from various places.
    - Tails Greeter:
      · hide all windows while logging in
      · resize and re-position the panel when the screen size grows
      · PostLogin: log into the Journal instead of a dedicated log file
      · use localectl to set the system locale and keyboard mapping
      · delete the Live user's password if no administration password is set
        (Closes: #5589)
      · port to GDBus greeter interface, and adjust to other GDM
        and GNOME changes
    - Tails Installer:
      · port to UDisks2, and from Qt4 to GTK3
      · adapt to work on other GNU/Linux operating systems than Tails
      · clean up enough upstream code and packaging bits to make it
        deserve being uploaded to Debian
      · rename everything from liveusb-creator to tails-installer
    - Port tails-perl5lib to GTK3 and UDisks2. In passing, do some minor
      refactoring and a GUI improvement.
    - Persistent Volume Assistant:
      · port to GTK3 and UDisks2
      · handle errors when deleting persistent volume (Closes: #8435)
      · remove obsolete workarounds
    - Don't install UDisks v1.
    - Adapt custom udev and polkit rules to UDisks v2 (Closes: #9054, #9270).
    - Adjust import-translations' post-import step for Tails Installer,
      to match how its i18n system works nowadays.
    - Use socket activation for CUPS, to save some boot time.
    - Set memlockd.service's OOMScoreAdjust to -1000.
    - Don't bother creating /var/lib/live in tails-detect-virtualization.
      If it does not exist at this point, we have bigger and more
      noticeable problems.
    - Simplify the virtualization detection & reporting system, and do it
      as a non-root user with systemd-detect-virt rather than virt-what.
    - Replace rsyslog with the systemd Journal (Closes: #8320), and adjust
      WhisperBack's logs handling accordingly.
    - Drop tails-save-im-environment.
      It's not been used since we stopped automatically starting the web browser.
    - Add a hook that aborts the build if any *.orig file is found. Such files
      appear mainly when a patch of ours is fuzzy. In most cases they are no big
      deal, but in some cases they end up being taken into account
      and break things.
    - Replace the tor+http shim with apt-transport-tor (Closes: #8198).
    - Install gnome-tweak-tool.
    - Don't bother testing if we're using dependency based boot.
    - Drop workaround to start spice-vdagent in GDM (Closes: #8025).
      This has been fixed in Jessie proper.
    - Don't install ipheth-utils anymore. It seems to be obsolete
      in current desktop environments.
    - Stop installing the buggy unrar-free, superseded in Jessie (Closes: #5838)
    - Drop all custom fontconfig configuration, and configure fonts rendering
      via dconf.
    - Drop zenity patch (zenity-fix-whitespacing-box-sizes.diff),
      that was applied upstream.
    - Install libnet-dbus-perl (currently 1.1.0) from jessie-backports,
      it brings new features we need.
    - Have the security check and the upgrader wait for Tor having bootstrapped
      with systemd unit ordering.
    - Get rid of tails-security-check's wrapper.
      Its only purpose was to wait for Tor to have bootstrapped,
      which is now done via systemd.
    - Don't allow the amnesia and tails-upgrade-frontend users to run
      tor-has-bootstrapped as root with sudo. They don't need it anymore,
      thanks to using systemd for starting relevant units only once Tor
      has bootstrapped.
    - Install python-nautilus, that enables MAT's context menu item in Nautilus.
      (Closes: #9151).
    - Configure GDM with a snippet file instead of patching its
      greeter.dconf-defaults.
    - WhisperBack:
      · port to Python 3 and GObject Introspection (Closes: #7755)
      · migrate from the gnutls module to the ssl one
      · use PGP/MIME for better attachments handling
      · migrate from the gnupginterface module to the gnupg one
      · natively support SOCKS ⇒ don't wrap with torsocks anymore
        (Closes: #9412)
      · don't try to include the obsolete .xession-errors in bug reports
        (Closes: #9966)
    - chroot-browser.sh: don't use static DISPLAY.
    - Simplify debugging:
      · don't hide the emergency shutdown's stdout
      · tails-unblock-network: trace commands so that they end up in the Journal
    - Configure the console codeset at ISO build time, instead of setting it
      to a constant via the Greeter's PostLogin.default.
    - Order the AppArmor policy compiling in a way that is less of a blocker
      during boot.
    - Include the major KMS modules in the initramfs. This helps seamless
      transition to X.Org when booting, and back to text mode on shutdown,
      can help for proper graphics hardware reinitialization post-kexec,
      and should improve GNOME Shell support in some virtual machines.
    - Always show the Universal Access menu icon in the GNOME panel.
    - Drop notification for not-migrated-yet persistence configuration,
      and persistence settings disabled due to wrong access rights.
      That migration happened more two years ago.
    - Remove the restricted network detector, that has been broken for too long;
      see #10560 for next steps (Closes: #8328).
    - Remove unsupported, never completed kiosk mode support.
    - clock_gettime_monotonic: use Perl's own function to get the integer part,
      instead of forking out to sed.
    - Don't (try to) disable lvm2 initscripts anymore. Both the original reason
      and the implementation are obsolete on Jessie.
    - Lower potential for confusion (#8443), by removing system-config-printer.
      One GUI to configure printers is enough (Closes: #8505).
    - Add "set -u" to tails-unblock-network.
    - Add a systemd target whose completion indicates that Tor has bootstrapped,
      and use it everywhere sensible (Closes: #9393).
    - Disable udev's 75-persistent-net-generator.rules, to preventing races
      between MAC spoofing and interface naming.
    - Replace patch against NetworkManager.conf with drop-in files.
    - Replace resolvconf with simpler NetworkManager and dhclient configuration.
      (Closes: #7708)
    - Replace patching of the gdomap, i2p, hdparm, tor and ttdnsd initscripts
      with 'systemctl disable' (Closes: #9881).
    - Replace patches that wrapped apps with torsocks with dynamic patching with
      a hook, to ease maintenance. Also, patch D-Bus services as needed
      (Closes: #10603).
    - Notify the user if running Tails inside non-free virtualization software
      that does not try to hide its nature (Closes: #5315).
      Thanks to Austin English <austinenglish@gmail.com> for the patch.
    - Declare htpdate.service as being needed for time-sync.target, to ensure
      that "services where correct time is essential should be ordered after
      this unit".
    - Convert some of the X session startup programs to `systemd --user' units.
    - Let the Pidgin wrapper pass through additional command-line arguments
      (Closes: #10383)
    - Move out of the $PATH a bunch of programs that users should generally
      not run directly: connect-socks, end-profile, getTorBrowserUserAgent,
      generate-tor-browser-profile, kill-boot-profile, tails-spoof-mac,
      tails-set-wireless-devices-state, tails-configure-keyboard,
      do_not_ever_run_me, boot-profile, tails-unblock-network,
      tor-controlport-filter, tails-virt-notify-user, tails-htp-notify-user,
      udev-watchdog-wrapper (Closes: #10658)
    - Upgrade I2P to 0.9.23-2~deb8u+1.
    - Disable I2P's time syncing support.
    - Install Torbirdy from official Jessie backports, instead of from
      our own APT repository (Closes: #10804).
    - Make GNOME Disks' passphrase strength checking new feature work,
      by installing cracklib-runtime (Closes: #10862).
    - Add support for Japanese in Tor Browser.
    - Install xserver-xorg-video-intel from Jessie Backports (currently:
      2.99.917-2~bpo8+1). This adds support for recent chips such as
      Intel Broadwell's HD Graphics (Closes: #10841).
    - Improve a little bit post-Greeter network unblocking:
      · Sleep a bit longer between deleting the blacklist, and triggering udev;
        this might help cure #9012.
      · Increase logging, so that we get more information next time someone
        sees #9012.
      · Touch /etc/modprobe.d/ after deleting the blacklist; this might help,
        in case all this is caused by some aufs bug.
    - Enable and use the Debian jessie-proposed-updates APT repository,
      anticipating on the Jessie 8.3 point-release (Closes: #10897).
    - Upgrade most firmware packages to 20160110-1.
    - Upgrade Intel CPU microcodes to 3.20151106.1~deb8u1.
    - Disable IPv6 for the default wired connection, so that
      NetworkManager does not spam the logs with IPv6 router
      solicitation failure. Note that this does not fix the problem
      for other connections (Partially closes: #10939).

  * Test suite
    - Adapt to the new desktop environment and applications' look.
    - Adapt new changed nmcli syntax and output.
    - New NetworkManager connection files must be manually loaded in Jessie.
    - Adapt to new pkexec behavior.
    - Adapt to how we now disable networking.
    - Use sysctl instead of echo:ing into /proc/sys.
    - Use oom_score_adj instead of the older oom_adj.
    - Adapt everything depending on logs to the use of the Journal.
    - Port to UDisks v2.
    - Check that the system partition is an EFI System Partition.
    - Add ldlinux.c32 to the list of bootloader files that are expected
      to be modified when we run syslinux (Closes: #9053).
    - Use apt(8) instead of apt-get(8).
    - Don't hide the cursor after opening the GNOME apps menu.
    - Convert the remote shell to into a systemd native service and a Python 3,
      script that uses the sd_notify facility (Closes: #9057). Also, set its
      OOM score adjustment value via its unit file, and not from the test suite.
    - Adjust to match where screenshots are saved nowadays.
    - Check that all system units have started (Closes: #8262)
    - Simplify the "too small device" test.
    - Spawn `poweroff' and `halt' in the background, and don't wait for them
      to return: anything else would be racy vs. the remote shell's stopping.
    - Bump video memory allocated to the system under test, to fix out of video
      memory errors.
    - When configuring the CPU to lack PAE support, use a qemu32 CPU instead
      of a Pentium one: the latter makes GNOME Shell crash.
      See #8778 for details about how Mesa's CPU features detection has
      room for improvement.
    - Adjust free(1) output parsing for Jessie.
    - vm-execute: rename --type option to --spawn.
    - Add method to set the X.Org clipboard, and install its dependency
      (xsel) in the ISO.
    - Paste URLs in one go, to work around issue with lost key presses
      in the browser (Closes: #10467).
    - Reliably wait for Synaptic's search button to fade in.
    - Take into account that the sticky bit is not set on block devices
      on Jessie anymore.
    - Ensure that we can use a NetworkManager connection stored in persistence
      (Closes: #7966).
    - Use a stricter regexp when extracting logs for dropped packets.
    - Clone the host CPU for the test suite guests (Closes: #8778).
    - Run ping as root (aufs does not support file capabilities so we don't
      get cap_net_raw+ep, and if built on a filesystem that does support
      file capabilities, then /bin/ping is not setupd root).
    - Escape regexp special characters when constructing the firewall log
      parsing regexp, and pass -P to grep, since Ruby uses PCRE.
    - Adjust is_persistent?() helper to findmnt changes in Jessie.
    - Rework in depth how we measure pattern coverage in memory, with more
      reliable Linux OOM and VM settings, fundamental improvements
      in what exactly we measure, and custom OOM adjutments for fillram
      processes (Closes: #9705).
    - Use blkid instead of parted to determine the filesystem type.
    - Use --kiosk mode instead of --fullscreen in virt-viewer, to remove
      the tiny border of the in-viewer menu.
    - Remove now redundant desktop screenshot directory scenario.
    - Adapt GNOME notification handling for Debian Jessie (Closes: #8782)
    - Disable screen blanking in the automated test suite, which occasionally
      breaks some test cases (Closes: #10403).
    - Move upgrade scenarios to the feature dedicated to them.
    - Don't make libvirt storage volumes executable.
    - Refactor the PAUSE_ON_FAIL functionality, so that we can use `pause()`
      as a breakpoint when debugging.
    - Drop non-essential Totem test that is mostly a duplicate, and too painful
      to be worth automating on Jessie.
    - Retry Totem HTTPS test with a new Tor circuit on failure.
    - Replace iptables status regexp-based parser with a new XML-based
      status analyzer: the previous implementation could not be adjusted
      to the new ip6tables' output (Closes: #9704).
    - Don't reboot in one instance when it is not needed.
    - Optimize memory erasure anti-test: block the boot to save CPU on the host.
    - Update I2P tests for Jessie, and generally make them more robust.
    - Update Electrum tests for 2.5.4-2 (Closes: #10758).
    - Add workaround for libvirt vs. guestfs permissions issue, to allow
      running the test suite on current Debian sid.
    - Fix buggy code, that happened to work by mistake, in the Seahorse
      test cases; bugfix on 1.8.
    - Update test suite images due to CSS change on Tails' website.
    - Adapt Tor Browser tests to work with the 5.5 series.
    - Automatically test downloading files in Tor Browser.
    - Remove obsolete scenario, that tested opening a downloaded file with
      an external application, which we do not support anymore.
    - Improve robustness of the "Tails OpenPGP keys" scenario (Closes: #10378).
    - Automatically test the "Diable all networking" feature (Closes: #10430).
    - Automatically test that SSH works over LAN (Closes: #9087).
    - Bump some statuc sleeps to fix a few race conditions (Closes: #5330).
    - Automatically test that an emergency shutdown triggers on boot
      medium removal (Closes: #5472).
    - Make the AppArmor checks actually detect errors (Closes: #10926).

  * Build system
    - Bump amount of disk space needed to build Tails with Vagrant.
      The addition of the Japanese Tor Browser tarball made us reach
      the limit of the previous value.

  * Adjustments for Debian 8 (Jessie) with no or very little user-visible impact
    - Free the fixed UIDs/GIDs we need before creating the corresponding users.
    - Replace the real gnome-backgrounds with a fake, equivs generated one
      (Closes: #8055). Jessie's gnome-shell depends on gnome-backgrounds,
      which is too fat to ship considering we're not using it.
    - AppArmor: adjust CUPS profile to support our Live system environment
      (Closes: #8261):
      · Mangle lib/live/mount/overlay/... as usual for aufs.
      · Pass the the attach_disconnected flag, that's needed for compatibility
        with PrivateTmp.
    - Make sure we don't ship geoclue* (Closes: #7949).
    - Drop deprecated GDM configuration file.
    - Don't add the Live user to the deprecated 'fuse' group.
    - Drop hidepid mount option for /proc (Closes: #8256). In its current,
      simplistic form it cannot be supported by systemd.
    - Don't manually load acpi-cpufreq at boot time. It fails to load
      whenever no device it supports is present, which makes the
      systemd-modules-load.service fail. These days, the kernel
      should just automatically load such modules when they are needed.
    - Drop sysvinit-specific (sensigs.omit.d) tweaks for memlockd.
    - Disable the GDM unit file's Restart=always, that breaks our "emergency
      shutdown on boot medium removal" feature.
    - Update the implementation of the memory erasure on shutdown feature:
      · check for rebooting state using systemctl, instead of the obsolete
        $RUNLEVEL (Closes: #8306)
      · the kexec-load initscript normally silently exits unless systemd is
        currently running a reboot job. This is not the case when the emergency
        shutdown has been triggered, so we removed this check
      · migrate tails-kexec to the /lib/systemd/system-shutdown/ facility
      · don't (try to) switch to tty1 on emergency shutdown: it apparently
        requires data that we haven't locked into memory, and then it blocks
        the whole emergency shutdown process
    - Display a slightly darker version of the desktop wallpaper on the screen
      saver, instead of the default flashy "Debian 8" branding (Closes: #9038).
    - Disable software autorun from external media.
    - Disable a few unneeded D-Bus services. Some of these services are
      automatically started (via D-Bus activation) when GNOME Shell tries
      to use them. The only "use" I've seen for them, except eating
      precious RAM, is to display "No appointment today" in the calendar pop-up.
      (Closes: #9037)
    - Prevent NetworkManager services from starting at boot time
      (Closes: #8313). We start them ourselves after changing the MAC address.
    - Unfuzzy all patches (Closes: #8268) and drop a few obsolete ones.
    - Adapt IBus configuration for Jessie (Closes: #8270), i.e. merge the two
      places where we configure keyboard layout and input methods: both are now
      configured in the same place in Jessie's GNOME.
    - Migrate panel launchers to the favorite apps list (Closes: #7992).
    - Drop pre-GNOME Shell menu tweaks.
    - Hide "Log out" button in the GNOME Shell menu (Closes: #8364).
    - Add a custom shutdown-helper GNOME Shell extension (Closes: #8302, #5684
      and #5878) that removes the press-Alt-to-turn-shutdown-button-into-Suspend
      functionality from the GNOME user menu, and makes Restart and Shutdown
      immediate, without further user interaction. Accordingly remove our custom
      Shutdown Helper panel applet (#8302).
    - Drop GNOME Panel configuration, now deprecated.
    - Disable GNOME Shell's screen lock feature.
      We're not there yet (see #5684).
    - Disable GNOME Shell screen locker's user switch feature.
    - Explicitly install libany-moose-perl (Closes: #8051).
      It's needed by our OpenPGP applet. On Wheezy, this package was pulled
      by some other dependency. This is not the case anymore on Jessie.
    - Don't install notification-daemon nor gnome-mag: GNOME Shell has taken
      over this functionality (Closes: #7481).
    - Don't install ntfsprogs: superseded on Jessie.
    - Don't install barry-util: not part of Jessie.
    - Link udev-watchdog dynamically, and lock it plus its dependencies
      in memory.
    - Migrate from gdm-simple-greeter to a custom gdm-tails session
      (Closes: #7599).
    - Update Plymouth installation and configuration:
      · install the plymouth packages via chroot_local-hooks: lb 2.x's "standard"
        packages list pulls console-common in, which plymouth now conflicts with
      · don't patch the plymouth initscript anymore, that was superseded
        by native systemd unit files
      · mask the plymouth-{halt,kexec,poweroff,reboot,shutdown} services,
        to prevent them from occupying the active TTY with an (empty) splash
        screen on shutdown/reboot, that would hide the messages we want to show
        to the user via tails-kexec (Closes: #9032)
    - Migrate GNOME keyboard layout settings from libgnomekbd to input-sources
      (Closes: #7898).
    - Explicitly install syslinux-efi, that we need and is not automatically
      pulled by anything else anymore.
    - Workaround #7248 for GDM: use a solid blue background picture,
      instead of a solid color fill, in the Greeter session.
    - De-install gcc-4.8-base and gcc-4.9 at the end of the ISO build process.
    - Revert the "Wrap syndaemon to always use -t" Wheezy-specific workaround.
    - htpdate: run date(1) in a Jessie-compatible (and nicer) way.
    - Remove obsolete dconf screenshot settings and the corresponding test.
    - Drop our patched python-dbus{,-dev} package (Closes: #9177).
    - live-persist: stop overriding live-boot's functions, we now have
      a recent enough blkid.
    - Adjust sdmem initramfs bits for Jessie:
      · Directly call poweroff instead of halt -p.
      · Don't pass -n to poweroff and reboot, it's not supported anymore.
    - Wrap text in the Unsafe Browser startup warning dialog
      (Jessie's zenity does not wrap it itself).
    - Associate application/pgp-keys with Seahorse's "Import Key" application
      (Closes: #10571).
    - Install topIcons GNOME Shell extension (v28), to work around the fact
      that a few of the applets we use hijack the notification area.
    - "cd /" to fix permissions issue at tails-persistence-setup startup
      (Closes: #8097).
    - Install gstreamer1.0-libav, so that Totem can play H264-encoded videos.
    - Adjust APT sources configuration:
      · remove explicit jessie and jessie-updates sources:
        automatically added by live-build
      · add Debian testing
      · add jessie-backports
    - Firewall: white-list access to the accessibility daemon (Closes: #8075).
    - Adjust to changed desktop notification behavior and supported feature set
      (Closes: #7989):
      · pass the DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS used by the GNOME session
        to notify-send
      · update waiting for a notification handler: gnome-panel and nm-applet
        are obsolete, GNOME Shell is now providing this facility, so instead
        wait for a process that starts once GNOME Shell is ready, namely
        ibus-daemon (Closes: #8685)
      · port tails-warn-about-disabled-persistence and tails-virt-notify-user
        to notification actions (instead of hyperlinks), and make the latter
        transient; to this end, add support to Desktop::Notify for "hints"
        and notification actions
      · tails-security-check: use a dialog box instead of desktop notifications
      · MAC spoofing failure notification: remove the link to the documentation;
        it was broken on Tails/Wheezy already, see #10559 for next steps
    - Don't explicitly install gnome-panel nor gnome-menus, so that they go away
      whenever the Greeter does not pull them in anymore.
    - Install gkbd-capplet, that provides gkbd-keyboard-display (Closes: #8363).
    - Install Tor 0.2.7 from deb.torproject.org: we don't need to rebuild it
      ourselves for seccomp support anymore.
    - Wrap Seahorse with torsocks when it is started as a D-Bus service too
      (Closes: #9792).
    - Rename the AppArmor profile for Tor, so it applies to the system-wide
      Tor service we run (Closes: #10528).
    - Essentially revert ALSA state handling to how it was pre-Jessie, so that
      mixer levels are unmuted and sanitized at boot time (Closes: #7591).
    - Pass --yes to apt-get when installing imagemagick.
    - Make removable devices, that we support installing Tails to, user writable:
      Tails Installer requires raw block device access to such devices
      (Closes: #8273). Similarly, allow the amnesia user, when active, to open
      non-system devices for writing with udisks2. This is roughly udisks2's
      equivalent of having direct write access to raw block storage devices.
      Here too, Tails Installer uses this functionality.
    - Disable networkd to prevent any risk of DNS leaks it might cause; and
      disable timesyncd, as we have our own time synchronization mechanism.
      They are not enabled by default in Jessie, but may be in Stretch,
      so let's be explicit about it.
    - Mask hwclock-save.service, to avoid sync'ing the system clock
      to the hardware clock on shutdown (Closes: #9363).
    - apparmor-adjust-cupsd-profile.diff: adjust to parse fine on Jessie
      (Closes: #9963)
    - Explicitly use tor@default.service when it's the one we mean.
    - Refactor GNOME/X env exporting to Tails' shell library, and grab
      more of useful bits of the desktop session environment.
      Then, use the result in the test suite's remote shell.
    - Stop tweaking /etc/modules. It's 2015, the kernel should load these things
      automatically (Closes: #10609).
    - Have systemd hardening let Tor modify its configuration (needed by Tor
      Launcher), and start obfs4proy (Closes: #10696, #10724).
    - Bump extensions.adblockplus.currentVersion and
      extensions.enigmail.configuredVersion to match what we currently get
      on Jessie.
    - I2P: switch from 'service' to 'systemctl' where possible.

      should work again. Note that the documentation has not been
      adapted to the slight changes in the Electrum account setup
      wizard yet.

  * Minor improvements
    - Upgrade I2P to 0.9.23-2~deb7u+1.
    - Rebase our patch against the Tor Browser AppArmor profile on top
      of the one shipped in torbrowser-launcher 0.2.1-2.
    - Warn if the claws-mail persistence is enabled and contains a
      Claws Mail configuration when starting icedove. (Closes: #10458)
    - Replace the Claws Mail GNOME launcher with Icedove. (Closes:
      #10739)
    - Remove the Claws Mail persistence feature from the Persistence
      Assistant. (Closes: #10742)

  * Build system
    - Simplify ISO image naming rules by using the base rule we use
      for Jenkins all the time, except when building from a tag
      (i.e. building a release).  (Closes: #10349)

  * Test suite
    - Lower the waiting time for USB installation in the test suite.
      So far we were waiting up to one hour, which is just the same as
      our Jenkins inactivity timeout, so in practice when Tails
      Installer fails and displays an error message, instead of
      reporting that the job failed (which is the point of the
      exercise) we abort the job due to this timeout which
      communicates less clearly that there's probably a bug. (Closes:

    - Remove the check for the sound icon in the systray in the
      Windows Camouflage tests. (Closes: #10493)
    - Retry running whois when "LIMIT EXCEEDED" is in its output for
      increased robustness. (Closes: #10523)
    - Make Seahorse tests more robust. (Closes: #9095, #10501)
    - Make the handling of Pidgin's account manager more robust.

tails (1.7) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Major new features and changes
    - Upgrade Tor Browser to 5.0.4. (Closes: #10456)
    - Add a technology preview of the Icedove Email client (a
      rebranded version of Mozilla Thunderbird), including OpenPGP
      support via the Enigmail add-on, general security and anonymity
      improvements via the Torbirdy add-on, and complete persistence
      support (which will be enabled automatically if you already have
      Claws Mail persistence enabled). Icedove will replace Claws Mail
      as the supported email client in Tails in a future
      release. (Closes: #6151, #9498, #10285)
    - Upgrade Tor to 0.2.7.4-rc-1~d70.wheezy+1+tails1. Among the many
      improvement of this new Tor major release, the new
      KeepAliveIsolateSOCKSAuth option allows us to drop the
      bug15482.patch patch (taken from the Tor Browse bundle) that
      enabled similar (but inferior) functionality for *all*
      SocksPort:s -- now the same circuit is only kept alive for
      extended periods for the SocksPort used by the Tor
      Browser. (Closes: #10194, #10308)
    - Add an option to Tails Greeter which disables networking
      completely. This is useful when intending to use Tails for
      offline work only. (Closes: #6811)

  * Security fixes
    - Fix CVE-2015-7665, which could lead to a network interface's IP
      address being exposed through wget. (Closes: #10364)
    - Prevent a symlink attack on ~/.xsession-errors via
      tails-debugging-info which could be used by the amnesia user to
      read the contents of any file, no matter the
      permissions. (Closes: #10333)
    - Upgrade libfreetype6 to 2.4.9-1.1+deb7u2.
    - Upgrade gdk-pixbuf packages to 2.26.1-1+deb7u2.
    - Upgrade Linux to 3.16.7-ckt11-1+deb8u5.
    - Upgrade openjdk-7 packages to 7u85-2.6.1-6~deb7u1.
    - Upgrade unzip to 6.0-8+deb7u4.

  * Bugfixes
    - Add a temporary workaround for an issue in our code which checks
      whether i2p has bootstrapped, which (due to some recent change
      in either I2P or Java) could make it appear it had finished
      prematurely. (Closes: #10185)
    - Fix a logical bug in the persistence preset migration code while
      real-only persistence is enabled. (Closes: #10431)

  * Minor improvements
    - Rework the wordings of the various installation and upgrade
      options available in Tails installer in Wheezy. (Closes: #9672)
    - Restart Tor if bootstrapping stalls for too long when not using
      pluggable transports. (Closes: #9516)
    - Install firmware-amd-graphics, and firmware-misc-nonfree instead
      of firmware-ralink-nonfree, both from Debian Sid.
    - Update the Tails signing key. (Closes: #10012)
    - Update the Tails APT repo signing key. (Closes: #10419)
    - Install the nmh package. (Closes: #10457)
    - Explicitly run "sync" at the end of the Tails Upgrader's upgrade
      process, and pass the "sync" option when remounting the system
      partition as read-write. This might help with some issues we've
      seen, such as #10239, and possibly for #8449 as well.

  * Test suite
    - Add initial automated tests for Icedove. (Closes: #10332)
    - Add automated tests of the MAC spoofing feature. (Closes: #6302)
    - Drop the concept of "background snapshots" and introduce a general
      system for generating snapshots that can be shared between
      features. This removes all silly hacks we previously used to
      "skip" steps, and greatly improves performance and reliability
      of the whole test suite. (Closes: #6094, #8008)
    - Flush to the log file in debug_log() so the debugging info can
      be viewed in real time when monitoring the debug log
      file. (Closes: #10323)
    - Force UTF-8 locale in automated test suite. Ruby will default to
      the system locale, and if it is non-UTF-8, some String-methods
      will fail when operating on non-ASCII strings. (Closes: #10359)
    - Escape regexp used to match nick in CTCP replies. Our Pidgin
      nick's have a 10% chance to include a ^, which will break that
      regexp. We need to escape all characters in the nick. (Closes:
      #10219)
    - Extract TBB languages from the Tails source code. This will
      ensure that valid locales are tested. As an added bonus, the
      code is greatly simplified. (Closes: #9897)
    - Automatically test that tails-debugging-info is not susceptible
      to the type of symlink attacks fixed by #10333.
    - Save all test suite artifacts in a dedicated directory with more
      useful infromation encoded in the path. This makes it easier to
      see which artifacts belongs to which failed scenario and which
      run. (Closes: #10151)
    - Log all useful information via Cucumber's formatters instead of
      printing to stderr, which is not included when logging to file
      via `--out`. (Closes: #10342)
    - Continue running the automated test suite's vnc server even if
      the client disconnects. (Closes: #10345)
    - Add more automatic tests for I2P. (Closes: #6406)
    - Bump the Tor circuit retry count to 10. (Closes: #10375)
    - Clean up dependencies: (Closes: #10208)
      * libxslt1-dev
      * radvd
      * x11-apps

tails (1.6) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Security fixes
    - Upgrade Tor Browser to 5.0.3. (Closes: #10223)
    - Upgrade bind9-based packages to 1:9.8.4.dfsg.P1-6+nmu2+deb7u7.
    - Upgrade liblcms1 to 1.19.dfsg2-1.2+deb7u1.
    - Upgrade libldap-2.4-2 to 2.4.31-2+deb7u1.
    - Upgrade libslp1 to 1.2.1-9+deb7u1.
    - Upgrade ssl-cert to 1.0.32+deb7u1.

  * Bugfixes
    - Fix a corner case for the MAC spoofing panic mode. If panic mode
      failed to disable the specific device that couldn't be spoofed
      (by unloading the module) we disable networking. Previously we
      only stopped NetworkManager. The problem is that NM isn't even
      started at this time, but will specifically be started when
      we're done with MAC spoofing. Therefore, let's completely
      disable NetworkManager so it cannot possibly be
      started. (Closes: #10160)
    - Avoid use of uninitialized value in restricted-network-detector.
      If NetworkManager decides that a wireless connection has timed
      out before "supplicant connection state" has occued, our idea of
      the state is `undef`, so it cannot be used in a string
      comparison. Hence, let's initialize the state to the empty
      string instead of `undef`. Also fix the state
      recording. Apparently NetworkManager can say a few different
      things when it logs the device state transitions. (Closes:
      #7689)

  * Minor improvements
    - Remove workaround for localizing search engine plugins. The
      workaround has recently become unnecessary, possibly due to the
      changes made for the seach bar after the Tor Browser was rebased
      on Firefox 38esr. (Closes: #9146)
    - Refer to the I2P Browser in the I2P notifications. Instead of
      some obscure links that won't work in the Tor Browser, where
      users likely will try them, and which I believe will open them
      by default. (Closes: #10182)
    - Upgrade I2P to 0.9.22. Also set the I2P apparmor profile to
      enforce mode. (Closes: #9830)

  * Test suite
    - Test that udev-watchdog is monitoring the correct device when
      booted from USB. (Closes: #9890)
    - Remove unused 'gksu' step. This causes a false-positive to be
      found for #5330. (Closes: #9877)
    - Make --capture capture individual videos for failed scenarios
      only, and --capture-all to capture videos for all scenarios.
      (Closes: #10148)
    - Use the more efficient x264 encoding when capturing videos using
      the --capture* options. (Closes: #10001)
    - Make --old-iso default to --iso if omitted. Using the same ISO
      for the USB upgrade tests most often still does what we want,
      e.g. test that the current version of Tails being tested has a
      working Tails installer. Hence this seems like a reasonable
      default. (Closes: #10147)
    - Avoid nested FindFailed exceptions in waitAny()/findAny(), and
      throw a new dedicated FindAnyFailed exception if these fail
      instead. Rjb::throw doesn't block Ruby's execution until the
      Java exception has been received by Ruby, so strange things can
      happen and we must avoid it. (Closes: #9633)
    - Fix the Download Management page in our browsers. Without the
      browser.download.panel.shown pref set, the progress being made
      will not update until after the browser has been restarted.
      (Closes: #8159)
    - Add a 'pretty_debug' (with an alias: 'debug') Cucumber formatter
      that deals with debugging instead of printing it to STDERR via
      the `--debug` option (which now has been removed). This gives us
      the full flexibility of Cucumber's formatter system, e.g. one
      easy-to-read formatter can print to the terminal, while we get
      the full debug log printed to a file. (Closes: #9491)
    - Import logging module in otr-bot.py. Our otr-bot.py does not use
      logging but the jabberbot library makes logging calls, causing a
      one-off message “No handlers could be found for logger
      "jabberbot"” to be printed to the console. This commit
      effectively prevents logging/outputting anything to the terminal
      which is at a level lower than CRITICAL. (Closes: 9375)
    - Force new Tor circuit and reload web site on browser
      timeouts. (Closes: #10116)
    - Focus Pidgin's buddy list before trying to access the tools
      menu. (Closes: #10217)
    - Optimize IRC test using waitAny. If connecting to IRC fails,
      such as when OFTC is blocking Tor, waiting 60 seconds to connect
      while a a Reconnect button is visible is sub-optimal. It would
      be better to try forcing a new Tor circuit and clicking the
      reconnect button. (Closes: #9653)
    - Wait for (and focus if necessary) Pidgin's Certificate windows.

tails (1.5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Major new features and changes
    - Move LAN web browsing from Tor Browser to the Unsafe Browser,
      and forbid access to the LAN from the former. (Closes: #7976)
    - Install a 32-bit GRUB EFI boot loader. This at least works
      on some Intel Baytrail systems. (Closes: #8471)

  * Security fixes
    - Upgrade Tor Browser to 5.0, and integrate it:
      · Disable Tiles in all browsers' new tab page.
      · Don't use geo-specific search engine prefs in our browsers.
      · Hide Tools -> Set Up Sync, Tools -> Apps (that links to the Firefox
        Marketplace), and the "Share this page" button in the Tool bar.
      · Generate localized Wikipedia search engine plugin icons so the
        English and localized versions can be distinguished in the new
        search bar. (Closes: #9955)
    - Fix panic mode on MAC spoofing failure. (Closes: #9531)
    - Deny Tor Browser access to global tmp directories with AppArmor,
      and give it its own $TMPDIR. (Closes: #9558)
    - Tails Installer: don't use a predictable file name for the subprocess
      error log. (Closes: #9349)
    - Pidgin AppArmor profile: disable the launchpad-integration abstraction,
      which is too wide-open.
    - Use aliases so that our AppArmor policy applies to
      /lib/live/mount/overlay/ and /lib/live/mount/rootfs/*.squashfs/ as well as
      it applies to /. And accordingly:
      · Upgrade AppArmor packages to 2.9.0-3~bpo70+1.
      · Install rsyslog from wheezy-backports, since the version from Wheezy
        conflicts with AppArmor 2.9.
      · Stop installing systemd for now: the migration work is being done in
        the feature/jessie branch, and it conflicts with rsyslog from
        wheezy-backports.
      · Drop apparmor-adjust-user-tmp-abstraction.diff: obsoleted.
      · apparmor-adjust-tor-profile.diff: simplify and de-duplicate rules.
      · Take into account aufs whiteouts in the system_tor profile.
      · Adjust the Vidalia profile to take into account Live-specific paths.
    - Upgrade Linux to 3.16.7-ckt11-1+deb8u3.
    - Upgrade bind9-host, dnsutils and friends to 1:9.8.4.dfsg.P1-6+nmu2+deb7u6.
    - Upgrade cups-filters to 1.0.18-2.1+deb7u2.

  * Bugfixes
    - Upgrade Tor to 0.2.6.10-1~d70.wheezy+1+tails1.

  * Minor improvements
    - Tails Installer: let the user know when it has rejected a candidate
      destination device because it is too small. (Closes: #9130)
    - Tails Installer: prevent users from trying to "upgrade" a device
      that contains no Tails, or that was not installed with Tails Installer.
      (Closes: #5623)
    - Install libotr5 and pidgin-otr 4.x from wheezy-backports. This adds
      support for the OTRv3 protocol and for multiple concurrent connections
      to the same account. (Closes: #9513)
    - Skip warning dialog when starting Tor Browser while being offline,
      in case it is already running. Thanks to Austin English for the patch!
      (Closes: #7525)
    - Install the apparmor-profiles package (Closes: #9539), but don't ship
      a bunch of AppArmor profiles we don't use, to avoid increasing
      boot time. (Closes: #9757)
    - Ship a /etc/apparmor.d/tunables/home.d/tails snippet, instead
      of patching /etc/apparmor.d/tunables/home.
    - live-boot: don't mount tmpfs twice on /live/overlay, so that the one which
      is actually used as the read-write branch of the root filesystem's union
      mount, is visible. As a consequence:
      · One can now inspect how much space is used, at a given time, in the
        read-write branch of the root filesystem's union mount.
      · We can make sure our AppArmor policy works fine when that filesystem
        is visible, which is safer in case e.g. live-boot's behavior changes
        under our feet in the future... or in case these "hidden" files are
        actually accessible somehow already.

  * Build system
    - Add our jenkins-tools repository as a Git submodule, and replace
      check_po.sh with a symlink pointing to the same script in that submodule.
      Adjust the automated test suite accordingly. (Closes: #9567)
    - Bump amount of RAM needed for Vagrant RAM builds to 7.5 GiB. In
      particular the inclusion of the Tor Browser 5.0 series has recently
      increased the amount of space needed to build Tails. (Closes: #9901)

  * Test suite
    - Test that the Tor Browser cannot access LAN resources.
    - Test that the Unsafe Browser can access the LAN.
    - Installer: test new behavior when trying to upgrade an empty device, and
      when attempting to upgrade a non-Tails FAT partition on GPT; also, take
      into account that all unsupported upgrade scenarios now trigger
      the same behavior.
    - Request a new Tor circuit and re-run the Seahorse and GnuPG CLI tests
      on failure. (Closes: #9518, #9709)
    - run_test_suite: remove control chars from log file even when cucumber
      exits with non-zero. (Closes: #9376)
    - Add compatibility with cucumber 2.0 and Debian Stretch. (Closes: #9667)
    - Use custom exception when 'execute_successfully' fails.
    - Retry looking up whois info on transient failure. (Closes: #9668)
    - Retry wget on transient failure. (Closes: #9715)
    - Test that Tor Browser cannot access files in /tmp.
    - Allow running the test suite without ntp installed. There are other means
      to have an accurate host system clock, e.g. systemd-timesyncd and tlsdate.
      (Closes: #9651)
    - Bump timeout in the Totem feature.
    - Grep memory dump using the --text option. This is necessary with recent
      versions of grep, such as the one in current Debian sid, otherwise it
      will count only one occurrence of the pattern we're looking for.
      (Closes: #9759)
    - Include execute_successfully's error in the exception, instead
      of writing it to stdout via puts. (Closes: #9795)
    - Test that udev-watchdog is actually monitoring the correct device.
      (Closes: #5560)
    - IUK: workaround weird Archive::Tar behaviour on current sid.
    - Test the SocksPort:s given in torrc in the Unsafe Browser.
      This way we don't get any sneaky errors in case we change them and
      forget to update this test.
    - Directly verify AppArmor blocking of the Tor Browser by looking in
      the audit log: Firefox 38 does no longer provide any graphical feedback
      when the kernel blocks its access to files the user wants to access.
    - Update browser-related automated test suite images, and workaround
      weirdness introduced by the new Tor Browser fonts.
    - Test that Pidgin, Tor Browser, Totem and Evince cannot access ~/.gnupg
      via alternate, live-boot generated paths.
    - Adjust tests to cope with our new AppArmor aliases.
    - Bump memory allocated to the system under test to 2 GB. (Closes: #9883)

    - Don't ship the snakeoil SSL key pair generated by ssl-cert in the ISO.
      (Closes: #9416)
    - Partially fix the truncated notifications issue. (#7249)

  * Minor improvements
    - Disable the hwclock.sh initscript at reboot/shutdown time.
      This is an additional safety measure to ensure that the hardware clock
      is not modified. (Closes: #9364)
    - Stop shipping /var/cache/man/*, to make ISOs and IUKs smaller.
      (Closes: #9417)
    - Update torbrowser-AppArmor-profile.patch to apply cleanly on top of the
      profile shipped with torbrowser-launcher 0.2.0-1.
    - Add the jessie/updates APT repo and set appropriate pinning.
    - Upgrade Electrum to 1.9.8-4~bpo70+1.

    - Don't modify files in the source tree before having possibly merged
      the base branch into it. (Closes: #9406)
    - Make it so eatmydata is actually used during a greater part of the build
      process. This includes using eatmydata from wheezy-backports.
      (Closes: #9419, #9523)
    - release script: adjust to support current Debian sid.

  * Test suite
    - Test the system clock sanity check we do at boot. (Closes: #9377)
    - Remove the impossible "Clock way in the past" scenarios.
      Thanks to config/chroot_local-includes/lib/live/config/0001-sane-clock,
      these scenarios cannot happen, and since we test that it works they
      can be safely removed.
    - Test that the hardware clock is not modified at shutdown. (Closes: #9557)
    - Pidgin: retry looking for the roadmap URL in the topic.
    - Avoid showing Pidgin's tooltips during test, potentially confusing Sikuli.
      (Closes: #9317)
    - Test all OpenPGP keys shipped with Tails. (Closes: #9402)
    - Check that notification-daemon is running when looking for notifications
      fails. (Closes: #9332)
    - Allow using the cucumber formatters however we want. (Closes: #9424)
    - Enable Spice in the guest, and blacklist the psmouse kernel module,
      to help with lost mouse events. (Closes: #9425)
    - Automate testing Torbutton's 'New Identity' feature. (Closes: #9286)
    - Test that Seahorse is configured to use the correct keyserver.
      (Closes: #9339)
    - Always export TMPDIR back to the test suite's shell environment.
      (Closes: #9479)
    - Make OpenPGP tests more reliable:
      · Retry accessing the OpenPGP applet menus on failure. (Closes: #9355)
      · Retry accessing menus in Seahorse on failure. (Closes: #9344)
    - Focus the Pidgin conversation window before any attempt to interact
      with it. (Closes: #9317)
    - Use convertkey from the (backported to Jessie) Debian package,
      instead of our own copy of that script. (Closes: #9066)
    - Make the memory erasure tests more robust (Closes: #9329):
      · Bump /proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes when running fillram.
      · Actually set oom_adj for the remote shell when running fillram.
      · Try to be more sure that we OOM kill fillram.
      · Run fillram as non-root.
    - Only try to build the storage pool if TailsToasterStorage isn't found.

 -- Tails developers <tails@boum.org>  Sun, 28 Jun 2015 19:46:25 +0200

tails (1.4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Major new features
    - Upgrade Tor Browser to 4.5.1, based on Firefox 31.7.0 ESR, which
      introduces many major new features for usability, security and
      privacy. Unfortunately its per-tab circuit view did not make it
      into Tails yet since it requires exposing more Tor state to the
      user running the Tor Browser than we are currently comfortable
      with. (Closes: #9031, #9369)
    - Upgrade Tor to 0.2.6.7-1~d70.wheezy+1+tails2. Like in the Tor
      bundled with the Tor Browser, we patch it so that circuits used
      for SOCKSAuth streams have their lifetime increased indefinitely
      while in active use. This currently only affects the Tor Browser
      in Tails, and should improve the experience on certain web sites
      that otherwise would switch language or log you out every ten
      minutes or so when Tor switches circuit. (Closes: #7934)

  * Security fixes
    - tor-browser wrapper script: avoid offering avenues to arbitrary
      code execution to e.g. an exploited Pidgin. AppArmor Ux rules
      don't sanitize $PATH, which can lead to an exploited application
      (that's allowed to run this script unconfined, e.g. Pidgin)
      having this script run arbitrary code, violating that
      application's confinement. Let's prevent that by setting PATH to
      a list of directories where only root can write. (Closes: #9370)
    - Upgrade Linux to 3.16.7-ckt9-3.
    - Upgrade curl to 7.26.0-1+wheezy13.
    - Upgrade dpkg to 1.16.16.
    - Upgrade gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad to 0.10.23-7.1+deb7u2.
    - Upgrade libgd2-xpm to 2.0.36~rc1~dfsg-6.1+deb7u1.
    - Upgrade openldap to 2.4.31-2.
    - Upgrade LibreOffice to 1:3.5.4+dfsg2-0+deb7u4.
    - Upgrade libruby1.9.1 to 1.9.3.194-8.1+deb7u5.
    - Upgrade libtasn1-3 to 2.13-2+deb7u2.
    - Upgrade libx11 to 2:1.5.0-1+deb7u2.
    - Upgrade libxml-libxml-perl to 2.0001+dfsg-1+deb7u1.
    - Upgrade libxml2 to 2.8.0+dfsg1-7+wheezy4.
    - Upgrade OpenJDK to 7u79-2.5.5-1~deb7u1.
    - Upgrade ppp to 2.4.5-5.1+deb7u2.

  * Bugfixes
    - Disable security warnings when connecting to POP3 and IMAP ports.
      (Closes: #9327)
    - Make the Windows 8 browser theme compatible with the Unsafe and I2P
      browsers. (Closes: #9138)
    - Hide Torbutton's "Tor Network Settings..." context menu entry.
      (Closes: #7647)
    - Upgrade the syslinux packages to support booting Tails on
      Chromebook C720-2800. (Closes: #9044)
    - Enable localization in Tails Upgrader. (Closes: #9190)
    - Make sure the system clock isn't before the build date during
      early boot. Our live-config hook that imports our signing keys
      depend on that the system clock isn't before the date when the
      keys where created. (Closes: #9149)
    - Set GNOME's OpenPGP keys via desktop.gnome.crypto.pgp to prevent
      us from getting GNOME's default keyserver in addition to our
      own. (Closes: #9233)
    - Prevent Firefox from crashing when Orca is enabled: grant
      it access to assistive technologies in its Apparmor
      profile. (Closes: #9261)
    - Add Jessie APT source. (Closes: #9278)
    - Fix set_simple_config_key(). If the key already existed in the
      config file before the call, all other lines would be removed
      due to the sed option -n and p combo. (Closes: #9122)
    - Remove illegal instance of local outside of function definition.
      Together with `set -e` that error has prevented this script from
      restarting Vidalia, like it should. (Closes: #9328)

  * Minor improvements
    - Upgrade I2P to 0.9.19-3~deb7u+1.
    - Install Tor Browser's bundled Torbutton instead of custom .deb.
      As of Torbutton 1.9.1.0 everything we need has been upstreamed.
    - Install Tor Browser's bundled Tor Launcher instead of our
      in-tree version. With Tor 0.2.6.x our custom patches for the
      ClientTransportPlugin hacks are not needed any more. (Closes:
      #7283)
    - Don't install msmtp and mutt. (Closes: #8727)
    - Install fonts-linuxlibertine for improved Vietnamese support in
      LibreOffice. (Closes: #8996)
    - Remove obsoletete #i2p-help IRC channel from the Pidgin
      configuration (Closes: #9137)
    - Add Gedit shortcut to gpgApplet's context menu. Thanks to Ivan
      Bliminse for the patch. (Closes: #9069).
    - Install printer-driver-gutenprint to support more printer
      models. (Closes: #8994).
    - Install paperkey for off-line OpenPGP key backup. (Closes: #8957)
    - Hide the Tor logo in Tor Launcher. (Closes: #8696)
    - Remove useless log() instance in tails-unblock-network. (Closes:
      #9034)
    - Install cdrdao: this enables Brasero to burn combined data/audio
      CDs and to do byte-to-byte disc copy.
    - Hide access to the Add-ons manager in the Unsafe Browser. It's
      currently broken (#9307) but we any way do not want users to
      install add-ons in the Unsafe Browser. (Closes: #9305)
    - Disable warnings on StartTLS for POP3 and IMAP (Will-fix: #9327)
      The default value of this option activates warnings on ports
      23,109,110,143. This commit disables the warnings for POP3 and
      IMAP as these could be equally used in encrypted StartTLS
      connections. (Closes: #9327)
    - Completely rework how we localize our browser by generating our
      branding add-on, and search plugins programatically. This
      improves the localization for the ar, es, fa, ko, nl, pl, ru,
      tr, vi and zh_CN locales by localizing the Startpage and
      Disconnect.me search plugins. Following Tor Browser 4.5's recent
      switch, we now use Disconnect.me as the default search
      engine. (Closes: #9309)
    * Actively set Google as the Unsafe Browser's default search
      engine.

  * Build system
    - Encode in Git which APT suites to include when building Tails.
      (Closes: #8654)
    - Clean up the list of packages we install. (Closes: #6073)
    - Run auto/{build,clean,config} under `set -x' for improved
      debugging.
    - Zero-pad our ISO images so their size is divisible by 2048.
      The data part of an ISO image's sectors is 2048 bytes, which
      implies that ISO images should always have a size divisible
      by 2048. Some applications, e.g. VirtualBox, use this as a sanity
      check, treating ISO images for which this isn't true as garbage.
      Our isohybrid post-processing does not ensure this,
      however. Also Output ISO size before/after isohybrid'ing and
      truncate'ing it. This will help detect if/when truncate is
      needed at all, so that we can report back to syslinux
      maintainers more useful information. (Closes: #8891)
    - Vagrant: raise apt-cacher-ng's ExTreshold preference to 50. The
      goal here is to avoid Tor Browser tarballs being deleted by
      apt-cacher-ng's daily expiration cronjob: they're not listed in
      any APT repo's index file, so acng will be quite eager to clean
      them up.

  * Test suite
    - Bring dependency checks up-to-date (Closes: #8988).
    - Adapt test suite to be run on Debian Jessie, which includes
      removing various Wheezy-specific workarounds, adding a few
      specific to Jessie, migrating from ffmpeg to libav, and
      more. (Closes: #8165)
    - Test that MAT can see that a PDF is dirty (Closes: #9136).
    - Allow throwing Timeout::Error in try_for() blocks, as well as
      nested try_for() (Closes: #9189, #9290).
    - Read test suite configuration files from the features/config/local.d
      directory. (Closes: #9220)
    - Kill virt-viewer with SIGTERM, not SIGINT, to prevent hordes of
      zombie processes from appearing. (Closes: #9139)
    - Kill Xvfb with SIGTERM, not SIGKILL, on test suite exit to allow
      it to properly clean up. (Closes: #8707)
    - Split SSH & SFTP configs in the test suite. (Closes: #9257)
    - Improve how we start subprocesses in the test suite, mostly by
      bypassing the shell for greater security and robustness (Closes:
      #9253)
    - Add Electrum test feature. (Closes #8963)
    - Test that Tails Installer detects when USB devices are
      removed. (Closes: #9131)
    - Test Tails Installer with devices which are too small. (Closes:
      #9129)
    - Test that the Report an Error launcher works in German. (Closes:
      #9143)
    - Verify that no extensions are installed in the Unsafe Browser
      using about:support instead of about:addons, which is broken
      (#9307). (Closes: #9306)
    - Retry GNOME application menu actions when they glitch. The
      GNOME application menus seem to have issues with clicks or
      hovering actions not registering, and hence sometimes submenus
      are not opened when they should, and sometimes clicks on the
      final application shortcut are lost. There seems to be a
      correlation between this and CPU load on the host running the
      test suite. We workaround this by simply re-trying the last
      action when it seems to fail. (Closes: #8928)
    - Work around Seahorse GUI glitchiness (Closes: #9343):
      * When Seahorse appears to be frozen--apparently due to network
        issues--it can often be worked around by refreshing the screen
        or activating a new window.
      * Open Seahorse's preferences dialog using the mouse.
      * Access menu entries with the mouse.
    - Wait for systray icons to finish loading before interacting with
      the systray. (Closes: #9258)
    - Test suite configuration: generalize local.d support to *.d. We
      now load features/config/*.d/*.yml.
    - Use code blocks in "After Scenario" hooks. This is much simpler
      to use (and more readable!) compared to hooking functions and
      arguments like we used to do.
    - Create filesystem share sources in the temporary directory and
      make them world-readable. (Closes: #8950)

    - Make Florence usable with touchpads by forcing syndaemon to
      always use the `-t` option, which only disables tapping and
      scrolling and not mouse movements (Closes: #9011).
    - Make tails-spoof-mac log the correct macchanger exit code on
      failure (Closes: #8687).
    - Tails Installer:
      · Ignore devices with less than 3.5 GB of storage since they
        do not fit a Tails installation (Closes: #6538).
      · Remove devices from the device list as they are unplugged
        (Closes: #8691).

  * Minor improvements
    - Install obfs4proxy 0.0.4-1~tpo1, which adds support for
      client-mode ScrambleSuit.
    - Don't start Vidalia if Windows Camouflage is enabled. (Closes:
      #7400)
    - I2P Browser:
      · Remove "Add-ons" from the Tools menu, and hide "Keyboard
        Shortcuts" and "Take a Tour" since they point to resources on
        the open Internet (Closes: #7970).
      · Hide TorButton button from the customize toolbar options, and
        remove configs whose only purpose was to make Torbutton "green"
        (Closes: #8893).

  * Test suite
    - New tests:
      · Test non-LAN SSH, and SFTP via GNOME's "Connect to Server"
        (Closes: #6308).
      · Verify that Tails' Tor binary has the expected Tor authorities
        hard coded (Closes: #8960).
    - Improvements:
      · Programmatically determine the supported languages when testing
        the Unsafe Browser (Closes: #8918).
      · Rename --temp-dir to --tmpdir and make it behave more like
        mktemp, and honour TMPDIR if set in the environment. (Closes:
        #8709).
    - Bugfixes:
      · Make --temp-dir (now --tmpdir) actually work.

      · Directory authority changes.
      · Fix assertion errors that may trigger under high DNS load.
      · No longer break on HUP with seccomp2 enabled.
      · and more - please consult the upstream changelog.
    - Upgrade Tor Launcher to 0.2.7.2, and update the test suite accordingly
      (Closes: #8964, #6985). Changes include:
      · Ask about bridges before proxy in wizard.
      · Hide logo if TOR_HIDE_BROWSER_LOGO set.
      · Remove firewall prompt from wizard.

      (Closes: #6558)
    - Repair config/chroot_local-packages feature, that was broken in Tails 1.3
      by 19-install-tor-browser-AppArmor-profile. (Closes: #8910)
    - language_statistics.sh: count original words instead of translated words.
      Otherwise we get >100% translation if translated strings are longer than
      original strings. (Closes: #9016)

  * Minor improvements
    - Only ship the new Tails signing key, and have Tails Upgrader stop trusting
      the old one. Update the documentation and test suite accordingly.
      (Closes: #8735, #8736, #8882, #8769, #8951)
    - Polish and harden a bit the WhisperBack configuration (Closes: #8991):
      · Only allow the `amnesia' user to run tails-debugging info as root
        with no arguments.
      · Fix spelling and grammar mistakes, improve phrasing a bit.
      · Quote variables consistently.

  * Test suite
    - New tests:
      · Chatting over XMPP in Pidgin, both peer-to-peer and in a multi-user
        chatroom. (Closes: #8002)
      · Chatting with OTR enabled over XMPP in Pidgin. (Closes: #8001)
      · Check that Pidgin only responds to the expected CTCP requests.
        (Closes: #8966)
      · Fetching keys using Seahorse started via the OpenPGP Applet.
      · Sync'ing keys using Seahorse.
    - Bugfixes:
      · Fix a race condition between the remote shell's and Tails Greeter's
        startup, by making sure the remote shell is ready before we start
        GDM. (Closes: #8941)
      · Kill virt-viewer properly. (Closes: #9070)
      · Make sure the display is stopped on destroy_and_undefine().
        Where we had it earlier, it could be skipped if anything else in the
        block threw an exception.
      · Fix wrong use of "$@". (Closes: #9071)
      · Enable the pipefail option in run_test_suite.

 -- Tails developers <tails@boum.org>  Mon, 23 Mar 2015 12:34:56 +0000

tails (1.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Major new features
    - Produce the Tails image in hybrid mode (again) so that the same
      image can be installed both on DVD *and* "hard disks" like USB
      storage and similar. (Closes: #8510)
    - Confine the Tor Browser using AppArmor. (Closes: #5525)
    - Install the Electrum bitcoin client from wheezy-backports, and
      add a persistence preset for the Live user's bitcoin wallet. If
      electrum is started without the persistence preset enabled, a
      warning is shown. (Closes: #6739)

  * Security fixes
    - Upgrade Tor Browser to 4.0.4 (based on Firefox 31.5.0esr)
      (Closes: #8938).

  * Bugfixes
    - Have tor_bootstrap_progress echo 0 if no matching log line is
      found. (Closes: #8257)
    - Always pass arguments through wrappers (connect-socks, totem,
      wget, whois) with "$@". $* doesn't handle arguments with
      e.g. embedded spaces correctly. (Closes: #8603, #8830)
    - Upgrade Linux to 3.16.7-ckt4-3.

  * Minor improvements
    - Install a custom-built Tor package with Seccomp enabled;
      enable the Seccomp sandbox when no pluggable transport is used.
      (Closes: #8174)
    - Install obfs4proxy instead of obfsproxy, which adds support for
      the obfs4 Tor pluggable transport. (Closes: #7980)
    - Install GnuPG v2 and associated tools from wheezy-backports,
      primarily for its improved support for OpenPGP smartcards. It
      lives side-by-side with GnuPG v1, which still is the
      default. (Closes: #6241)
    - Install ibus-unikey, a Vietnamese input method for IBus. (Closes:
      #7999)
    - Install torsocks (2.x) from wheezy-backports. (Closes: #8220)
    - Install keyringer from Debian Jessie. (Closes: #7752)
    - Install pulseaudio-utils.
    - Remove all traces of Polipo: we don't use it anymore. This
      closes #5379 and #6115 because:
      * Have APT directly use the Tor SOCKS proxy. (Closes: #8194)
      * Wrap wget with torsocks. (Closes: #6623)
      * Wrap Totem to torify it with torsocks. (Closes: #8219)
      * Torify Git with tsocks, instead of setting GIT_PROXY_COMMAND.
        (Closes: #8680)
    - Use torsocks for whois and Gobby, instead of torify.
    - Upgrade I2P to 0.9.18-1~deb7u+1.
    - Refactor the Unsafe and I2P browser code into a common shell
      library. A lot of duplicated code is now shared, and the code
      has been cleaned up and made more reliable. Several
      optimizations of memory usage and startup time were also
      implemented. (Closes: #7951)
    - Invert Exit and About in gpgApplet context menu. This is a
      short-term workaround for making it harder to exit the
      application by mistake (e.g. a double right-click). (Closes:
      #7450)
    - Implement new touchpad settings. This enables tap-to-click,
      2-fingers scrolling, and disable while typing. We don't enable
      reverse scrolling nor horizontal scrolling. (Closes: #7779)
    - Include the mount(8) output and live-additional-software.conf in
      WhisperBack bug reports (Closes: #8719, #8491).
    - Reduce brightness and saturation of background color. (Closes:
      #7963)
    - Have ALSA output sound via PulseAudio by default. This gives us
      centralized sound volume controls, and... allows to easily, and
      automatically, test that audio output works from Tor Browser,
      thanks to the PulseAudio integration into the GNOME sound
      control center.
    - Import the new Tails signing key, which we will use for Tails
      1.3.1, and have Tails Upgrader trust both it and the "old"
      (current) Tails signing key. (Closes: #8732)
    - tails-security-check: error out when passed an invalid CA file.
      Unfortunately, the underlying HTTPS stack we use here fails open
      in those case, so we have to check it ourselves. Currently, we
      check that the file exists, is readable, is a plain file and is
      not empty. Also support specifying the CA file via an
      environment variable. This will ease development and bug-fixing
      quite a bit.
    - Fix racy code in Tails Installer that sometimes made the
      automated test suite stall for scenarios installing Tails
      to USB disks. (Closes: #6092)
    - Make it possible to use Tails Upgrader to upgrade a Tails
      installation that has cruft files on the system partition.
      (Closes: #7678)

  * Build system
    - Install syslinux-utils from our builder-wheezy APT repository in
      Vagrant. We need version 6.03~pre20 to make the Tails ISO image
      in hybrid mode
    - Update deb.tails.boum.org apt repo signing key. (Closes: #8747)
    - Revert "Workaround build failure in lb_source, after creating
      the ISO." This is not needed anymore given the move to the Tor
      SOCKS proxy. (Closes: #5307)
    - Remove the bootstrap stage usage option and disable all
      live-build caching in Vagrant. It introduces complexity and
      potential for strange build inconsistencies for a meager
      reduction in build time. (Closes: #8725)
    - Hardcode the mirrors used at build and boot time in auto/config.
      Our stuff will be more consistent, easier to reproduce, and our
      QA process will be more reliable if we all use the same mirrors
      at build time as the ones we configure in the ISO. E.g. we won't
      have issues such as #8715 again. (Closes: #8726)
    - Don't attempt to retrieve source packages from local-packages so
      local packages can be installed via
      config/chroot_local-packages. (Closes: #8756)
    - Use our own Tor Browser archive when building an ISO. (Closes:
      #8125)

  * Test suite
    - Use libguestfs instead of parted when creating partitions and
      filsystems, and to check that only the expected files
      persist. We also switch to qcow2 as the default disk image
      format everywhere to reduce disk usage, enable us to use
      snapshots that includes the disks (in the future), and to use
      the same steps for creating disks in all tests. (Closes: #8673)
    - Automatically test that Tails ignores persistence volumes stored
      on non-removable media, and doesn't enable swaps. (Closes:
      #7822)
    - Actually make sure that Tails can boot from live systems stored
      on a hard drive. Running the 'I start Tails from DVD ...' step
      will override the earlier 'the computer is set to boot from ide
      drive "live_hd"' step, so let's make the "from DVD" part
      optional; it will be the default any way.
    - Make it possible to use an old iso with different persistence
      presets. (Closes: #8091)
    - Hide the cursor between steps when navigating the GNOME
      applications menu. This makes it a bit more robust, again:
      sometimes the cursor is partially hiding the menu entry we're
      looking for, hence preventing Sikuli from finding it (in
      particular when it's "Accessories", since we've just clicked on
      "Applications" which is nearby). (Closes: #8875)
    - Ensure that the test will fail if "apt-get X" commands fail.
    - Test 'Tor is ready' notification in a separate scenario. (Closes:
      #8714)
    - Add automated tests for torified wget and whois. This should
      help us identify future regressions such as #8603 in their
      torifying wrappers.
    - Add automated test for opening an URL from Pidgin.
    - And add automated tests for the Tor Browser's AppArmor
      sandboxing.
    - Test that "Report an Error Launcher" opens the support
      documentation.
    - Test that the Unsafe Browser:
      * starts in various locales.
      * complains when DNS isn't configured.
      * tears down its chroot on shutdown.
      * runs as the correct user.
      * has no plugins or add-ons installed.
      * has no unexpected bookmarks.
      * has no proxy configured.
    - Bump the "I2P router console is ready" timeout in its test to
      deal with slow Internet connections.
    - Make the automatic tests of gpgApplet more robust by relying
      more on graphical elements instead of keyboard shortcuts and
      static sleep():s. (Closes: #5632)
    - Make sure that enough disk space is available when creating
      virtual storage media. (Closes: #8907)
    - Test that the Unsafe Browser doesn't generate any non-user
      initiated traffic, and in particular that it doesn't check for
      upgrades, which is a regression test for #8694. (Closes: #8702)
    - Various robustness improvements to the Synaptic tests. (Closes:
      #8742)
    - Automatically test Git. (Closes: #6307)
    - Automatically test GNOME Screenshot, which is a regression test
      for #8087. (Closes: #8688)
    - Fix a quoting issue with `tails_persistence_enabled?`. (Closes:
      #8919)
    - Introduce an improved configuration system that also can store
      local secrets, like user credentials needed for some
      tests. (Closes: #6301, #8188)
    - Actually verify that we successfully set the time in our time
      syncing tests. (Closes: #5836)
    - Automatically test Tor. This includes normal functionality and
      the use pluggable transports, that our Tor enforcement is
      effective (e.g. only the Tor network or configured bridges are
      contacted) and that our stream isolation configuration is
      working. (Closes: #5644, #6305, #7821)

 -- Tails developers <tails@boum.org>  Mon, 23 Feb 2015 17:14:00 +0100

tails (1.2.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Security fixes
    - Upgrade Linux to 3.16.7-ckt2-1.
    - Upgrade Tor Browser to 4.0.3 (based on Firefox 31.4.0esr)
      (Closes: #8700).
    - Fail safe by entering panic mode if macchanger exits with an
      error, since in this situation we have to treat the
      driver/device state as undefined. Also, we previously just
      exited the script in this case, not triggering the panic mode
      and potentially leaking the real MAC address (Closes: #8571).
    - Disable upgrade checking in the Unsafe Browser. Until now the
      Unsafe Browser has checked for upgrades of the Tor Browser in
      the clear (Closes: #8694).

  * Bugfixes
    - Fix startup of the Unsafe Browser in some locales (Closes: #8693).
    - Wait for notification-daemon to run before showing the MAC
      spoofing panic mode notifications. Without this, the "Network
      card disabled" notification is sometimes lost when MAC spoofing
      fails. Unfortunately this only improves the situation, but
      doesn't fix it completely (see #8685).
    - Log that we're going to stop NetworkManager before trying to do
      it in the MAC spoofing scripts. Without this we wouldn't get the
      log message in case stopping NetworkManager fails (thanks to
      `set -e`).
    - Set GNOME Screenshot preferences to save the screenshots in
      /home/amnesia (Closes: #8087).
    - Do not suspend to RAM when closing the lid on battery power
      (Closes: #8071).
    - Properly update the Tails Installer's status when plugging in a
      USB drive after it has started (Closes: #8353).
    - Make rsync compare file contents by using --checksum for more
      reliable generation of the squashfs filesystem in
      IUKs. Previously it used the default, which is checking
      timestamps and file size, but that doesn't play well with the
      Tor browser files, that have a fixed mtime, which could result
      in updated files not ending up in the IUK.

  * Minor improvements
    - Finish migrating tails-security-check's and tails-iuk's pinning
      to our website's new X.509 certificate authority (Closes: #8404).

  * Build system
    - Update to Vagrant build box tails-builder-20141201. The only
      change is the removal of a reference to an ISO image which
      doesn't exist (except on the system that generated the build
      box) which causes an error for some users (Closes: #7644).
    - Generate the list of packages used during build, after building
      with Jenkins (Closes: #8518). This allows tracking their status
      on the Debian reproducible build front:
      https://reproducible.debian.net/index_pkg_sets.html#tails

  * Automated test suite
    - Check PO files with i18nspector (Closes: #8359).
    - Fix the expected image of a check.tp.o failure. Previously we
      looked for the "Sorry. You are not using Tor." text, but it
      seems it recently changed enough for Sikuli to not find it. To
      prevent future errors of the same kind we'll look for the
      crossed-over onion icon instead (Closes: #8533).
    - Bump timeout when waiting for Tor to re-bootstrap. We have a
      dreaded issue with timeouts that are multiple of 2 minutes, and
      then Tor succeeds soon after, so in order to allow for this
      timeout to be reached twice, and then possibly succeed, let's
      use N*2 minutes + 30 seconds, with N=2.

 -- Tails developers <tails@boum.org>  Wed, 14 Jan 2015 16:12:26 +0100

tails (1.2.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Bugfixes
    - Create a CA bundle for Tails Upgrader at ISO build time, and
      patch Tails Upgrader to use it. Specifically this will make it
      possible to check for Tails upgrades after our website changes
      certificate around the 2014 to 2015 transition (Partially fixes
      #8404).

 -- Tails developers <tails@boum.org>  Mon, 15 Dec 2014 10:05:17 +0100

tails (1.2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Security fixes
    - Upgrade Linux to 3.16.0-4, i.e. 3.16.7-1.
    - Install Tor Browser 4.0.2 (based on Firefox 31.3.0esr).

  * Bugfixes
    - Install syslinux-utils, to get isohybrid back (Closes: #8155).
    - Update xserver-xorg-input-evdev to 1:2.7.0-1+tails1 which
      includes a patch that restores mouse scrolling in KVM/Spice
      (Closes: 7426).
    - Set Torbutton logging preferences to the defaults (Closes:
      #8160). With the default settings, no site-specific information is
      logged.
    - Use the correct stack of rootfs:s for the chroot browsers (Closes:
      #8152, #8158). After installing incremental upgrades Tails' root
      filesystem consists of a stack squashfs:s, not only
      filesystem.squashfs. When not stacking them correct we may end up
      using the Tor Browser (Firefox) from an older version of Tails, or
      with no Tor Browser at all, as in the upgrade from Tails 1.1.2 to
      1.2, when we migrated from Iceweasel to the Tor Browser. Based on
      a patch contributed by sanic.
    - Use the Tor Browser for MIME type that GNOME associates with
      Iceweasel (Closes: #8153). Open URLs from Claws Mail, KeePassX
      etc. should be possible again.
    - Update patch to include all Intel CPU microcodes (Closes: #8189).
    - AppArmor: allow Pidgin to run Tor Browser unconfined, with
      scrubbed environment (Closes: #8186). Links opened in Pidgin are
      now handled by the Tor Browser.
    - Install all localized Iceweasel search plugins (Closes: #8139).
    - When generating the boot profile, ignore directories in
      process_IN_ACCESS as well (Closes: #7925). This allows ut to
      update the squashfs-ordering again in Tails 1.2.1.
    - gpgApplet: Don't pass already encoded data to GTK2 (Closes:
      #7968). It's now possible to clearsign text including non-ASCII
      characters.
    - Do not run the PulseAudio initscript, neither at startup nor
      shutdown (Closes: #8082).

  * Minor improvements
    - Upgrade I2P to 0.9.17-1~deb7u+1.
    - Make GnuPG configuration closer to the best practices one
      (Closes: #7512).
    - Have GnuPG directly use the Tor SOCKS port (Closes: #7416).
    - Remove TrueCrypt support and documentat how to open TrueCrypt
      volumes using cryptsetup (Closes: #5373).
    - Install hopenpgp-tools from Debian Jessie.

  * Build system
    - Add gettext >= 0.18.3 as a Tails build dependency. We need it for
      xgettext JavaScript support in feature/jessie.

  * Automated test suite
    - Don't click to open a sub-menu in the GNOME applications menu
      (Closes: #8140).
    - When testing the Windows camouflage, look for individual systray
      applets, to avoid relying on their ordering (Closes: #8059).
    - Focus the Pidgin Buddy List before looking for something
      happening in it (Closes: #8161).
    - Remove workaround for showing the TBB's menu bar (Closes #8028).

tails (1.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Major new features
    - Migrate from Iceweasel to the Tor Browser from the Tor Browser
      Bundle 4.0 (based on Firefox 31.2.0esr). This fixes the POODLE
      vulnerability.
      The installation in Tails is made global (multi-profile), uses
      the system-wide Tor instance, disables the Tor Browser updater,
      and keeps the desired deviations previously present in Iceweasel,
      e.g. we install the AdBlock Plus add-on, but not Tor Launcher (since
      we run it as a standalone XUL application), among other things.
    - Install AppArmor's userspace tools and apparmor-profiles-extra
      from Wheezy Backports, and enable the AppArmor Linux Security
      Module. This adds Mandatory Access Control for several critical
      applications in Tails, including Tor, Vidalia, Pidgin, Evince
      and Totem.
    - Isolate I2P traffic from the Tor Browser by adding a dedicated
      I2P Browser. It is set up similarly to the Unsafe Browser,
      but further disables features that are irrelevant for I2P, like
      search plugins and the AdBlock Plus addon, while keeping Tor Browser
      security features like the NoScript and Torbutton addons.
    - Upgrade Tor to 0.2.5.8-rc-1~d70.wheezy+1.

  * Security fixes
    - Disable TCP timestamps (Closes: #6579).

  * Bugfixes
    - Remove expired Pidgin certificates (Closes: #7730).
    - Use sudo instead of gksudo for running tails-upgrade-frontend to
      make stderr more easily accessible (Closes: #7431).
    - Run tails-persistence-setup with sudo instead of gksudo to make
      stderr more easily accessible, and allow the desktop user to
      pass the --verbose parameter (Closes: #7623).
    - Disable CUPS in the Unsafe Browser. This will prevent the
      browser from hanging for several minutes when accidentally
      pressing CTRL+P or trying to go to File -> Print (Closes: #7771).

  * Minor improvements
    - Install Linux 3.16-3 (version 3.16.5-1) from Debian
      unstable (Closes: #7886, #8100).
    - Transition away from TrueCrypt: install cryptsetup and friends
      from wheezy-backports (Closes: #5932), and make it clear that
      TrueCrypt will be removed in Tails 1.2.1 (Closes: #7739).
    - Install Monkeysign dependencies for qrcodes scanning.
    - Upgrade syslinux to 3:6.03~pre20+dfsg-2~bpo70+1, and install
      the new syslinux-efi package.
    - Upgrade I2P to 0.9.15-1~deb7u+1
    - Enable Wheezy proposed-updates APT repository and setup APT
      pinnings to install packages from it.
    - Enable Tor's syscall sandbox. This feature (new in 0.2.5.x)
      should make Tor a bit harder to exploit. It is only be enabled
      when when no special Tor configuration is requested in Tails
      Greeter due to incompatibility with pluggable transports.
    - Start I2P automatically when the network connects via a
      NetworkManager hook, and "i2p" is present on the kernel command
      line. The router console is no longer opened automatically, but
      can be accessed through the I2P Browser (Closes: #7732).
    - Simplify the IPv6 ferm rules (Closes: #7668).
    - Include persistence.conf in WhisperBack reports (Closes: #7461)
    - Pin packages from testing to 500, so that they can be upgraded.
    - Don't set Torbutton environment vars globally (Closes: #5648).
    - Enable VirtualBox guest additions by default (Closes: #5730). In
      particular this enables VirtualBox's display management service.
    - In the Unsafe Browser, hide option for "Tor Browser Health
      report", and the "Get Addons" section in the Addon manager
      (Closes: #7952).
    - Show Pidgin's formatting toolbar (Closes: #7356). Having the
      formatting toolbar displayed in Pidgin makes the OTR status more
      explicit by displaying it with words.

  * Automated test suite
    - Add --pause-on-fail to ease VM state debugging when tests
      misbehave.
    - Add execute_successfully() and assert_vmcommand_success() for
      added robustness when executing some command in the testing VM.
    - Use Test::Unit::Assertions instead of our home-made assert().
    - Add test for persistent browser bookmarks.
    - Add basic tests for Pidgin, Totem and Evince, including their
      AppArmor enforcement.
    - Factorize some common step pattern into single steps.
    - Factorize running a command in GNOME Terminal.
    - Add common steps to copy a file and test for its existence.
    - Add a wait_and_double_click Sikuli helper method.
    - Add a VM.file_content method, to avoid repeating ourselves, and
      use it whenever easily doable.
    - Drop test that diffs syslinux' exithelp.cfg: we don't ship this
      file anymore.
    - In the Unsafe Browser tests, rely on subtle timing less (Closes:
      #8009).
    - Use the same logic to determine when Tor is working in the test
      suite as in Tails itself. The idea is to avoid spamming the Tor
      control port during bootstrap, since we've seen problems with
      that already.

      (fixes Mozilla#1064636).
    - Install Linux 3.16-1 from sid (Closes: #7886).

tails (1.1.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Security fixes
    - Upgrade the web browser to 24.8.0esr-0+tails1~bpo70+1
      (Firefox 24.8.0esr + Iceweasel patches + Torbrowser patches).
      Also import the Tor Browser profile at commit
      271b64b889e5c549196c3ee91c888de88148560f from
      ttp/tor-browser-24.8.0esr-3.x-1.
    - Upgrade Tor to 0.2.4.23-2~d70.wheezy+1 (fixes CVE-2014-5117).
    - Upgrade I2P to 0.9.14.1-1~deb7u+1.
    - Upgrade Linux to 3.14.15-2 (fixes CVE-2014-3534, CVE-2014-4667

      CVE-2014-3510, CVE-2014-3511, CVE-2014-3512 and CVE-2014-5139).
    - Upgrade krb5-based packages to 1.10.1+dfsg-5+deb7u2 (fixes
      CVE-2014-4341, CVE-2014-4342, CVE-2014-4343, CVE-2014-4344 and
      CVE-2014-4345).
    - Upgrade libav-based packages to 6:0.8.15-1 (fixes CVE-2011-3934,
      CVE-2011-3935, CVE-2011-3946, CVE-2013-0848, CVE-2013-0851,
      CVE-2013-0852, CVE-2013-0860, CVE-2013-0868, CVE-2013-3672,
      CVE-2013-3674 and CVE-2014-2263.
    - Upgrade libgpgme11 to 1.2.0-1.4+deb7u1 (fixes CVE-2014-5117).
    - Upgrade python-imaging to 1.1.7-4+deb7u1 (fixes CVE-2014-3589).
    - Prevent dhclient from sending the hostname over the network
      (Closes: #7688).
    - Override the hostname provided by the DHCP server (Closes: #7769).
    - Add an I2P boot parameter. Without adding "i2p" to the kernel
      command line, I2P will not be accessible for the Live user.
    - Stricter I2P firewall rules:
      * deny I2P from accessing the LAN
      * deny I2P from accessing the loopback device, except for select
        whitelisted services
      * allow I2P access to the Internet
      The ACCEPT rules will only be enabled when the string 'i2p' is
      passed at the boot prompt. The rules which DENY or REJECT
      access for the 'i2psvc' user will always be applied.
    - Disable I2P plugins, since it doesn't make much sense without
      persistence, and should eliminate some attack vectors.
    - Disable I2P's BOB port. No maintained I2P application uses it.

  * Bugfixes
    - Fix condition clause in tails-security-check (Closes: #7657).
    - Don't ship OpenJDK 6: I2P prefers v7, and we don't need both.
    - Prevent Tails Installer from updating the system partition
      properties on MBR partitions (Closes: #7716).

  * Minor improvements
    - Upgrade to Torbutton 1.6.12.1.
    - Install gnome-user-guide (Closes: #7618).
    - Install cups-pk-helper (Closes: #7636).
    - Update the SquashFS sort file.
    - Compress the SquashFS more aggressively (Closes: #7706).
    - I2P: Keep POP3 email on server. The default in the I2P webmail
      app was to keep mail on the server, but that setting was changed
      recently. This configuration setting (susimail.config) will only
      be copied over in I2P 0.9.14 and newer.
    - Add a Close button to the Tails Installer launcher window.

  * Build system
    - Migrate Vagrant basebox to Debian Wheezy (Closes #7133, #6736).
    - Consistently use the same Debian mirror.
    - Disable runtime APT proxy configuration when using APT in
      binary_local-hooks (Closes: #7691).

  * Automated test suite
    - Automatically test hostname leaks (Closes: #7712).
    - Move autotest live-config hook to be run last. This way we'll
      notice if some earlier live-config hook cancels all hooks by
      running the automated test suite since the remote shell won't be
      running in that case.
    - Test that the I2P boot parameter does what it's supposed to do
      (Closes: #7760).
    - Start applications by using the GNOME Applications menu instead
      of the GNOME Run Dialog (Closes: #5550, #7060).

 -- Tails developers <tails@boum.org>  Sun, 31 Aug 2014 20:49:28 +0000

tails (1.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Rebase on Debian Wheezy
    - Upgrade literally thousands of packages.
    - Migrate to GNOME3 fallback mode.
    - Install LibreOffice instead of OpenOffice.
    - Remove custom LSB logging: Wheezy has fancy colored init
      logging.

  * Major new features
    - UEFI boot support.
    - Replace the Windows XP camouflage with an experimental Windows 8
      camouflage.
    - Install Linux 3.14.12-1 from Debian unstable.
    - Bring back VirtualBox guest modules, installed from Wheezy
      backports. Full functionality is only available when using the
      32-bit kernel.

  * Security fixes
    - Fix write access to boot medium via udisks (#6172).
    - Don't allow the desktop user to pass arguments to
      tails-upgrade-frontend (Closes: #7410).
    - Make persistent file permissions safer (Closes #7443):
      * Make the content of /etc/skel non-world-readable. Otherwise,
        such files may be copied to /home/amnesia, and in turn to the
        persistent volume, with unsafe permissions. That's no big deal
        in /home/amnesia (that is itself not world-readable), *but*
        the root of the persistent volume has to be world-readable.
      * Have activate_custom_mounts create new directories with safe
        permissions.
      * Set strict permissions on /home/amnesia (Closes: #7463).
      * Fix permissions on persistent directories that were created
        with unsafe permissions (Closes: #7458).
      * Fix files ownership while copying persistence (Closes: #7216).
        The previous instructions to copy the persistent data were
        creating personal files that belong to root. I don't think
        there is a way of preserving the original ownership using
        Nautilus (unless doing a "move" instead of a "copy" but that's
        not what we are trying to do here).
    - Disable FoxyProxy's proxy:// protocol handler (Closes: #7479).
      FoxyProxy adds the proxy:// protocol handler, which can be used
      to configure the proxy via an URI. A malicious web page can
      include (or a malicious exit node can inject) some JavaScript
      code to visit such an URI and disable or otherwise change
      Iceweasel's proxy settings. While using this to disable
      proxying will be dealt with safely by our firewall, this could
      be used to defeat stream isolation, although the user must be
      tricked into accepting the new proxy settings.
    - Upgrade the web browser to 24.7.0esr-0+tails1~bpo70+1
      (Firefox 24.7.0esr + Iceweasel patches + Torbrowser patches).
    - Upgrade to Linux 3.14.12-1 (fixes CVE-2014-4699).
    - Upgrade libav-based packages to 0.8.13-1 (fixes CVE-2014-4609).
    - Upgrade to libxml2 2.8.0+dfsg1-7+wheezy1 (fixes CVE-2014-0191).
    - Upgrade to dbus 1.6.8-1+deb7u3 (fixes CVE-2014-3477,
      CVE-2014-3532 and CVE-2014-3533).

  * Bugfixes
    - Disable GNOME keyring's GnuPG functionality. (Closes: #7330) In
      feature/regular-gnupg-agent, we installed the regular GnuPG
      agent so that it is used instead of GNOME keyring's one. This is
      not enough on Wheezy, so let's disable the starting of the "gpg"
      component of GNOME keyring.
    - Make sure /etc/default/locale exists, with a sensible default
      value (Closes: #7333). Before Tails Greeter's PostLogin script
      are run, /etc/default/locale does not exist on Wheezy. Our
      tails-kexec initscript (and quite a few other scripts we run)
      depends on this file to exist. So, let's make sure it exists,
      with a sensible default value.
    - Create the tails-persistence-setup user with the same UID/GID it
      had on Tails/Squeeze. (Closes: #7343) Else, our various checks
      for safe access rights on persistence.conf fail.
    - Revert back to browsing the offline documentation using Iceweasel
      instead of Yelp (Closes: #7390, #7285).
    - Make the new NetworkManager configuration directory persistent,
      when the old one was, but disable the old one (Closes: #7338).
    - Before running tails-upgrade-frontend, chdir to a world-readable
      place (Closes: #7641). In particular, Archive::Tar::Wrapper,
      when called by tails-install-iuk, wants to chdir back to the
      original cwd after it has chdir'd elsewhere to do its job.

  * Minor improvements
    - Install seahorse-nautilus, replacing seahorse-plugins (Closes #5516).
    - Install hledger (custom backport, for now): our accountants need this.
    - Install stable Scribus instead of scribus-ng.
    - Install the printer driver for Epson Inkjet that use ESC/P-R.
    - Install the BookletImposer PDF imposition toolkit. It's tiny,
      and really helpful e.g. when producing booklets.
    - Install gtkhash and nautilus-gtkhash (Closes #6763).
    - Import new version of Tor Launcher:
      · Now based on upstream Tor Launcher 0.2.5.4.
      · Tor bug #11772: Proxy Type menu not set correctly
      · Tor bug #11699: Change &amp;#160 to &#160; in network-settings.dtd
      · Correctly handle startup paths that contain dot.
    - Upgrade to Torbutton 1.6.9.0.
    - Avoid shipping python2.6 in addition to python2.7.
    - Don't install Gobby 0.4 anymore. Gobby 0.5 has been available in
      Debian since Squeeze, now is a good time to drop the obsolete
      0.4 implementation.
    - Require a bit less free memory before checking for upgrades with
      Tails Upgrader. The general goal is to avoid displaying "Not
      enough memory available to check for upgrades" too often due to
      over-cautious memory requirements checked in the wrapper.
    - Make Tails Greeter's help window resolution-aware. Previously it
      used a static 800x600 which was problematic on lower resolutions,
      and sub-optimal on higher resolutions. Now it adapts itself
      according to the screen resolution.
    - Whisperback now sanitizes attached logs better with respect to
      DMI data, IPv6 addresses, and serial numbers (Closes #6797,
      #6798, #6804).
    - Integrate the new logo in Tails Installer (Closes #7095)
    - Also install linux-base and linux-compiler-gcc-4.8-x86 from
      sid. This way, we can get rid of our linux-compiler-gcc-4.8-x86
      3.12, and it makes things a bit more consistent.
    - Include the syslinux binary, and its MBR, in the ISO filesystem.
      This in turn allows Tails Installer to use this binary and MBR,
      which is critical for avoiding problems (such as #7345) on
      "Upgrade from ISO".
    - Include syslinux.exe for win32 in utils/win32/ on the ISO
      filesystem (Closes: #7425).
    - Tails Installer:
      * Add consistent margins in GUI.
      * Always reset the target drive's MBR, without asking for
        confirmation, after installing or upgrading.
      * Install the bootloader using the syslinux binary found on the
        target device, once the Live OS has been extracted/copied
        there.
    - Enable double-clicking to pick entries in the language or
      keyboard layout lists in Tails Greeter.
    - Install backport of shared-mime-info 1.3 (Closes: #7079).
    - Make sanity-check prompts closable in Tails Persistence Setup
      (Closes: #7119).
    - Fix quick search in Tails Greeter's Other languages window
      (Closes: #5387).
    - Install systemd. It is not enabled by default, but having it
      around will help doing the migration work.
    - Enable AppArmor on the kernel command-line. This is a no-op
      without the userspace tools and with no profile shipped, but it
      will make it easier to fix this part of the situation.

  * Build system
    - Bump Vagrant builder's memory for RAM builds. Wheezy requires
      more space to build, and the resulting image is larger.
    - Fix Vagrant compatibility issue. Some classes' methods/fields
      have been renamed between Vagrant versions, so we need a simple
      compatibility layer to support all versions. Without this, it's
      not possible to issue e.g. a `build` command to an already
      running (i.e. `vm:up`:ed) Vagrant instance.
    - Move cpu and mem checks to the `build` task. Previously, when
      they were checked in `vm:up` *only* when issued while the VM
      already is up, so these checks weren't run if one issues a
      `build` when the VM is off. Now we'll fail earlier with a more
      informative error message, and it looks like a more logical home
      for them too.
    - Fix buggy memory checks for RAM building. We have to take into
      account which state the Vagrant VM is in for determining *where*
      we check if enough memory is available for a RAM build. If it's
      off, we check the host; if it's on we check the VM. Previously
      we always checked the host, which doesn't make sense when the VM
      is already started.

  * Automated test suite
    - Bump the tester VM's RAM by 256 MiB. There is not enough free
      RAM to run Tails Upgrader with just 1 GiB of RAM after the
      migration to Wheezy.
    - Always adjust OOM and memory overcommit settings. The kernel
      freezes seem to also happen for the amd64 kernel when filling
      the memory.
    - Add option to make Sikuli rety on FindFailed. This makes it
      possible to update manu images for Sikuli in just *one* test
      suite run, by continuously updating outdated pictures as we go.
    - Actually run "Upgrade from ISO" from a USB drive running the old
      version. That's what users do, and is buggy.
    - Automatically test persistent directories permissions (Closes: #7560).
    - Use read-write persistence when testing upgraded USB
      installations.  Otherwise e.g. the permission fixes won't get
      applied, and the subsequent steps testing the permissions will
      fail.
    - Actually check that the ISO's Tails is installed. The step
      "Tails is installed on USB drive $TARGET" only checks that the
      *running* Tails is installed on $TARGET, which obviously fails
      when doing an upgrade from ISO running an old Tails. That it
      worked for the same scenario running the current Tails is just
      coincidental.
    - Use OpenJDK 7 to run our test suite (Closes #7175).
    - Use qemu-system-x86_64 directly, instead of kvm, for running the
      automated test suite (Closes: #7605).

tails (1.0.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Security fixes
    - Upgrade the web browser to 24.6.0esr-0+tails1~bpo60+1
      (Firefox 24.6.0esr + Iceweasel patches + Torbrowser patches).
      Also import the Tor Browser profile at commit
      90ba8fbaf6f23494f1a0e38d63153b3b7e65d3d3 from
      ttp/tor-browser-24.6.0esr-3.x-1.
    - Install Linux 3.14 from Debian unstable (fixes CVE-2014-3153 and
      others).
    - Install openssl from Squeeze LTS (fixes CVE-2014-0076,
      CVE-2014-0195, CVE-2014-0221, CVE-2014-3470 and CVE-2014-0224).
    - Install GnuTLS from Squeeze LTS (fixes CVE-2014-3466.).

  * Minor improvements
    - Add Squeeze LTS APT sources. It has been given a low pinning
      priority so explicit pinning must be used to actually install
      anything from it.
    - Upgrade Tor to 0.2.4.22-1~d60.squeeze+1.
    - Upgrade I2P to 0.9.13-1~deb6u+1.

 -- Tails developers <tails@boum.org>  Sun, 08 Jun 2014 19:14:00 +0200

tails (1.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Security fixes
    - Upgrade the web browser to 24.5.0esr-0+tails1~bpo60+1
      (Firefox 24.5.0esr + Iceweasel patches + Torbrowser patches).
    - Upgrade Tor to 0.2.4.21-1+tails1~d60.squeeze+1:
      * Based on 0.2.4.21-1~d60.squeeze+1.
      * Backport the fix for Tor bug #11464. It adds client-side blacklists for
        all Tor directory authority keys that was vulnerable to Heartbleed.
        This protects clients in case attackers were able to compromise a
        majority of the authority signing and identity keys.

   * Bugfixes
    - Disable inbound I2P connections. Tails already restricts incoming
      connections, but this change tells I2P about it.
    - Fix link to the system requirements documentation page in the Tails
      Upgrader error shown when too little RAM is available.

  * Minor improvements
    - Upgrade I2P to 0.9.12-2~deb6u+1.
    - Import TorBrowser profile. This was forgotten in Tails 0.23 and even
      though we didn't explicitly set those preferences in that release
      they defaulted to the same values. This future-proofs us in case the
      defaults would ever change.
    - Import new custom version of tor-launcher:
      * Based on upstream Tor Launcher 0.2.5.3.
      * Improve how Tor Launcher handles incomplete translation.
        (Tor bug #11483; more future-proof fix for Tails bug #6885)
      * Remove the bridge settings prompt. (Tor bug #11482; closes Tails
        bug #6934,)
      * Always show bridge help button. (Tor bug #11484)
    - Integrate the new Tails logo into various places:
      * The website
      * The boot splash
      * The "About Tails" dialog

  * Build system
    - Use the stable APT suite when building from the stable Git branch
      (Closes: #7022).

  * Test suite
    - Add test for the #7022 fix.

tails (0.23) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Security fixes
    - Upgrade the web browser to 24.4.0esr-0+tails1~bpo60+1
      (Firefox 24.4.0esr + Iceweasel patches + Torbrowser patches).

  * Major new features
    - Spoof the network interfaces' MAC address by default (Closes: #5421),
      as designed on https://tails.boum.org/contribute/design/MAC_address/.
    - Rework the way to configure how Tor connects to the network
      (bridges, proxy, fascist firewall): add an option to Tails Greeter,
      start Tor Launcher when needed (Closes: #5920, #5343).

  * Bugfixes
    - Additional software: do not crash when persistence is disabled
      (Closes: #6440).
    - Upgrade Pidgin to 2.10.9, that fixes some regressions introduced
      in the 2.10.8 security update (Closes: #6661).
    - Wait for Tor to have fully bootstrapped, plus a bit more time,
      before checking for upgrades (Closes: #6728) and unfixed known
      security issues.
    - Disable the Intel Management Engine Interface driver (Closes: #6460).
      We don't need it in Tails, it might be dangerous, and it causes bugs
      on various hardware such as systems that reboot when asked to shut down
    - Add a launcher for the Tails documentation. This makes it available
      in Windows Camouflage mode (Closes: #5374, #6767).
    - Remove the obsolete wikileaks.de account from Pidgin (Closes: #6807).

  * Minor improvements
    - Upgrade Tor to 0.2.4.21-1~d60.squeeze+1.
    - Upgrade obfsproxy to 0.2.6-2~~squeeze+1.
    - Upgrade I2P to 0.9.11-1deb6u1.
    - Install 64-bit kernel instead of the 686-pae one (Closes: #5456).
      This is a necessary first step towards UEFI boot support.
    - Install Monkeysign (in a not-so-functional shape yet).
    - Disable the autologin text consoles (Closes: #5588). This was one of
      the blockers before a screen saver can be installed
      in a meaningful way (#5684).
    - Don't localize the text consoles anymore: it is broken on Wheezy,
      the intended users can as well use loadkeys, and we now do not have
      to trust setupcon to be safe for being run as root by the desktop user.
    - Make it possible to manually start IBus.
    - Reintroduce the possibility to switch identities in the Tor Browser,
      using a filtering proxy in front of the Tor ControlPort to avoid giving
      full control over Tor to the desktop user (Closes: #6383).
    - Incremental upgrades improvements:
      · Drop the Tails Upgrader launcher, to limit users' confusion
        (Closes: #6513).
      · Lock down sudo credentials a bit.
      · Hide debugging information (Closes: #6505).
      · Include ~/.xsession-errors in WhisperBack bug reports.
        This captures the Tails Upgrader errors and debugging information.
      · Report more precisely why an incremental upgrade cannot be done
        (Closes: #6575).
      · Various user interface and phrasing improvements.
    - Don't install the Cookie Monster browser extension (Closes: #6790).
    - Add a browser bookmark pointing to Tor's Stack Exchange (Closes: #6632).
    - Remove the preconfigured #tor channel from the Pidgin: apparently,
      too many Tails users go ask Tails questions there, without making
      it clear that they are running Tails, hence creating a user-support
      nightmare (Closes: #6679).
    - Use (most of) Tor Browser's mozconfig (Closes: #6474).
    - Rebase the browser on top of iceweasel 24.3.0esr-1, to get
      the certificate authorities added by Debian back (Closes: #6704).
    - Give access to the relevant documentation pages from Tails Greeter.
    - Hide Tails Greeter's password mismatch warning when entry is changed.
    - Persistent Volume Assistant:
      · Take into account our installer is now called Tails Installer.
      · Optimize window height (Closes: #5458).
      · Display device paths in a more user-friendly way (Closes: #5311).

  * Build system
    - Ease updating POT and PO files at release time, and importing translations
      from Transifex (Closes: #6288, #6207).
    - Drop custom poedit backport, install it from squeeze-backports-sloppy.
    - Make ISO and IUK smaller (Closes: #6390, #6425):
      · Exclude more files from being included in the ISO.
      · Remove *.pyc later so that they are not recreated.
      · Truncate log files later so that they are not filled again.
      · At ISO build time, set mtime to the epoch for large files whose content
        generally does not change between releases. This forces rsync
        to compare the actual content of these files, when preparing an IUK,
        instead of blindly adding it to the IUK merely because the mtime
        has changed, while the content is the same.
    - Make local hooks logging consistent.

  * Test suite
    - Migrate from JRuby to native Ruby + rjb.
    - The test suite can now be run on Debian Wheezy + backports.
    - Fix buggy "persistence is not enabled" step (Closes: #5465).
    - Use IPv6 private address as of RFC 4193 for the test suite's virtual
      network. Otherwise dnsmasq from Wheezy complains, as it is not capable
      of handling public IPv6 addresses.
    - Delete volumes after each scenario unless tagged @keep_volumes.
    - Add an anti-test to make sure the memory erasure test works fine.
    - A *lot* of bugfixes, simplifications and robustness improvements.

tails (0.22.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Security fixes
    - Upgrade the web browser to 24.3.0esr-0+tails1~bpo60+2
      (Firefox 24.3.0esr + Iceweasel patches + Torbrowser patches).
    - Upgrade NSS to 3.14.5-1~bpo60+1.
    - Upgrade Pidgin to 2.10.8.
    - Workaround browser size fingerprinting issue by using small icons
      in the web browser's navigation toolbar (Closes: #6377).
      We're actually hit by Tor#9268, and this is the best workaround gk
      and I were able to find when discussing this on Tor#10095.

  * Major new features
    - Check for upgrades availability using Tails Upgrader, and propose
      to apply an incremental upgrade whenever possible (Closes: #6014).
      · Run tails-update-frontend at session login time.
      · Have tails-security-check only report unfixed security issues.
      · Greatly improve the Tails Upgrader UI and strings phrasing.
      · Enable startup notification for Tails Upgrader.
    - Install Linux 3.12 (3.12.6-2) from Debian testing. Unfortunately,
      this breaks the memory wipe feature on some hardware (#6460), but
      it fixes quite a few security issues, and improves hardware support.
    - Update the build system to be compatible with Vagrant 1.2 and 1.3,
      in addition to the already supported versions (Closes: #6221).
      Thanks to David Isaac Wolinsky <isaac.wolinsky@gmail.com>.

  * Bugfixes
    - Do not start IBus for languages that don't need it. This fixes
      the keybindings problems introduced in 0.22 (Closes: #6478).
      Thanks to WinterFairy.
    - Disable network.proxy.socks_remote_dns in the Unsafe Browser.
      Bugfix against 0.22 (Closes: #6479).
    - Fetch Tor Browser User-Agent from its own prefs, rather than from
      the obsolete Torbutton ones. Bugfix against 0.22 (Closes: #6477).
    - Upgrade Vagrant basebox to include up-to-date Debian archive keys
      (Closes: #6515, #6527).
    - Do not use a non-working proxy for downloading the Vagrant basebox
      (Closes: #6514).
    - Use IE's icon in Windows camouflage mode.
      Bugfix against 0.22 (Closes: #6536).
    - Support "upgrading" a partial Tails installation (Closes: #6438)
      and fix missing confirmation dialog in Tails Installer (Closes: #6437).
      Thanks to Andres Gomez Ramirez <andres.gomez@cern.ch>.
    - Fix browser homepage in Spanish locales (Closes: #6612).

  * Minor improvements
    - Tor 0.2.4 is stable! Adapt APT sources accordingly.
    - Update Tor Browser to 24.2.0esr-1+tails1, that uses its own NSS
      library instead of the system one.
    - Update Torbutton to 1.6.5.3.
    - Do not start Tor Browser automatically, but notify when Tor is ready.
      Warn the user when they attempt to start Tor Browser before Tor is ready.
    - Import Tor Browser profile at
      3ed5d9511e783deb86835803a6f40e7d5a182a12 from ttp/tor-browser-24.2.0esr-1.
    - Use http.debian.net for Vagrant builds, instead of the mostly broken
      (and soon obsolete) cdn.debian.net.
    - Phrasing and UI improvements in tails-upgrade-frontend.
    - Style and robustness improvements in tails-security-check.
    - Make room for upcoming UEFI support in Tails Installer.

tails (0.22) unstable; urgency=medium

  [Tails developers]
  * Security fixes
    - Upgrade to Iceweasel 24.2.0esr that fixes a few serious security issues.
    - Stop migrating persistence configuration and access rights. Instead,
      disable all persistence configuration files if the mountpoint has wrong
      access rights (Closes: #6413).
    - Upgrade to NSS 3.15.3 that fixes a few serious security issues affecting
      the browser, such as CVE-2013-1741, CVE-2013-5605 and CVE-2013-5606.

  * Major improvements
    - Switch to Iceweasel 24 (Closes: #6370).
      · Resync' (most) Iceweasel prefs with TBB 3.0-beta-1 and get rid
        of many obsolete or default settings.
      · Disable WebRTC (Closes: #6468).
      · Import TorBrowser profile at commit
        51bf06502c46ee6c1f587459e8370aef11a3422d from the tor-browser-24.2.0esr-1
        branch at https://git.torproject.org/tor-browser.git.
    - Switch to Torbutton 1.6.5 (Closes: #6371).
      · Prevent Torbutton from asking users to "upgrade TBB".
      · Use the same Tor SOCKS port as the TBB (9151) for our web browser.
        This should be enough to avoid being affected by Tor#8511.
      · Disable Torbutton 1.6's check for Tor.
        Unfortunately, the new check.torproject.org breaks the remote Tor
        check. We cannot use the local Tor check with the control port. So,
        the shortest and sanest path to fixing the check issue, because the
        remote Tor check is broken" seems to simply disable this check.
        Patch submitted upstream as Tor#10216.
    - Prepare incremental upgrades to be the next default way to upgrade Tails,
      on point-releases at least.

  * Bugfixes
    - Deny X authentication only after Vidalia exits (Closes: #6389).
    - Disable DPMS screen blanking (Closes: #5617).
    - Fix checking of the persistent volume's ACL.
    - Sanitize more IP and MAC addresses in bug reports (Closes: #6391).
    - Do not fail USB upgrade when the "tmp" directory exists on the
      destination device.
    - Tails Installer: list devices with isohybrid Tails installed
      (Closes: #6462).

  * Minor improvements
    - Create a configuration file for additional software if needed
      (Closes: #6436).
    - Translations all over the place.
    - Enable favicons in Iceweasel.
    - Do not propose to make permanent NoScript exceptions.
      In Tails, every such thing is temporary, so better only display the menu
      entry that's about temporarily allowing something.
    - Clearer warning when deleting persistent volume (thanks to Andres Gomez
      Ramirez <andres.gomez@cern.ch> for the patch).
    - Make wording in Tails Installer more consistent.

  [ WinterFairy ]
  * Use IBus instead of SCIM (Closes: #5624, #6206).
    It makes it possible to input passwords in pinentry for at least Japanese,
    Chinese and Korean languages.
  * Add an import-translation script.
    This automates the importation process of completed translations
    from Transifex.
  * Always list optimal keyboard layout in the greeter (Closes: #5741).
  * Fix on-the-fly translation of the greeter in various languages
    (Closes: #5469).

  [ Kytv]
  * Update I2P to 0.9.8.1 (Closes: #6080, #5889).
  * Improve I2P configuration:
    - Disable IPv6 support in a nicer way.
    - Disable i2cp (allows java clients to communicate from outside the JVM). If
      this is unset an exception for port 7654 would need to be added to ferm.
    - Disable "in-network" updates (this is also done in the regular I2P
      packages).
    - Disable the outproxies. Access to the Internet is already routed through
      Tor so these are unnecessary. If end-users have a good reason to go
      through one of the I2P outproxies they can turn them back on.
  * Add a couple of default I2P IRC channels to Pidgin.
  * Allow access to the local 'eepsite' through FoxyProxy.
  * Add firewall exceptions for the standard I2P ports.

tails (0.21) unstable; urgency=low

  * Security fixes
    - Don't grant access to the Tor control port for the desktop user
      (amnesia). Else, an attacker able to run arbitrary code as this user
      could obtain the public IP with a get_info command.
      · Vidalia is now run as a dedicated user.
      · Remove the amnesia user from the debian-tor group.
      · Remove the Vidalia launcher in the Applications menu.
        The Vidalia instance it starts is useless, since it can't connect
        to the Tor control port.
    - Don't allow the desktop user to directly change persistence settings.
      Else, an attacker able to run arbitrary code as this user could
      leverage this feature to gain persistent root access, as long as
      persistence is enabled.
      · Fully rework the persistent filesystem and files ownership
        and permissions.
      · Run the Persistent Volume Assistant as a dedicated user, that is
        granted the relevant udisks and filesystem -level credentials.
      · At persistence activation time, don't trust existing persistence
        configuration files, migrate to the new ownership and permissions,
        migrate every known-safe existing settings and backup what's left.
        Warn the user when not all persistence settings could be migrated.
      · Persistent Volume Assistant uses the new ownership and permissions
        scheme when initializing a new persistent volume, and refuses to
        read persistence.conf if it, or the parent directory, hasn't the
        expected permissions.
      · Make boot medium 'system internal' for udisks with bilibop.
        Once Tails is based on Wheezy, this will further complete the
        protection (see #6172 for details).
    - Update Iceweasel to 17.0.10esr-0+tails2~bpo60+1.
    - Update Torbutton to 1.5.2-2, including a patch cherry-picked from
      upstream to make window resizing closer to what the design says.

  * Major new features
    - Add a persistence preset for printing settings (Closes: #5686).
      Reload CUPS configuration after persistence activation.
    - Support SD card connected through a SDIO host adapter (Closes: #6324).
      · Rebrand Tails USB installer to Tails installer.
      · Display devices brand, model and size in the Installer
        (Closes: #6292).
      · Ask for confirmation before installing Tails onto a device
        (Closes: #6293).
      · Add support for SDIO and MMC block devices to the Tails Installer
        (Closes: #5744) and the Persistent Volume Assistant (Closes: #6325).
      · Arm the udev watchdog when booted from SD (plugged in SDIO) too
        (Closes: #6327).

  * Minor improvements
    - Provide a consistent path to the persistent volume mountpoint
      (Closes: #5854).
    - Add a KeePassX launcher to the top GNOME panel (Closes: #6290).
    - Rework bug reporting workflow: point the desktop launcher to
      the troubleshooting page.
    - Make /home world-readable at build time, regardless of the Git
      working copy permissions. This makes the build process more robust
      against strict umasks.
    - Add signing capabilities to the tails-build script (Closes: #6267).
      This is in turn used to sign ISO images built by our Jenkins setup
      (Closes: #6193).
    - Simplify the ikiwiki setup and make more pages translatable.
    - Exclude the version string in GnuPG's ASCII armored output.
    - Prefer stronger ciphers (AES256,AES192,AES,CAST5) when encrypting
      data with GnuPG.
    - Use the same custom Startpage search URL than the TBB.
      This apparently disables the new broken "family" filter.
    - Update AdBlock Plus patterns.
    - Install Linux from Debian testing.
      (That is, the same version that was shipped in 0.20.1.)

  * Test suite
    - Look for "/tmp/.X11-unix/X${1#:}" too when detecting displays in use.
    - Adapt tests to match the Control Port access security fix:
      · Take into account that the amnesia user isn't part of the debian-tor
        group anymore.
      · Run as root the checks to see if a process is running: this
        is required to see other users' processes.

  - Install Iceweasel 17.0.9esr with Torbrowser patches.
  - Install Linux kernel 3.10-3 (version 3.10.11-1) from sid.

  * Bugfixes
  - Remount persistence devices read-only at shutdown/reboot time
    (Closes: #6228).
  - Greeter: display a warning icon on admin password mismatch and on
    persistence unlocking failure. Thanks to Andres Gomez Ramirez
    <andres.gomez@cern.ch> for the fix!
  - Don't torsocksify Pidgin.
    Instead we disable Pidgin's GNOME integration to get the "Global proxy
    configuration", which we set to use Tor. This fixes the I2P IRC account.
  - Additional software: fix typo in notification.
  - Allow installing "Priority: standard" packages that we do not install
    by default: remove them late in the build process instead of assigning
    them a -1 APT pinning level.

  * Minor improvements
  - Update AdBlock Plus patterns.
  - Use more unique ISO file name when building from Jenkins.
  - Additional software: point to the system log on upgrade failure.
  - Set SOCKS5_USER and SOCKS5_PASSWORD in the connect-socks wrapper (used
    by Git). Else, Tor 0.2.4's IsolateSOCKSAuth and connect-proxy
    sometimes play together in some way that makes connect-proxy ask for
    a password to connect to the SocksPort. SOCKS5_USER and
    SOCKS5_PASSWORD are passed through unchanged if they were manually set
    by the user already.
  - Use our custom connect-socks wrapper for SSH. Else, Tor 0.2.4's
    IsolateSOCKSAuth and connect-proxy sometimes play together in some way
    that makes connect-proxy ask for a password to connect to the
    SocksPort. Note that connect-socks uses the default SocksPort too, so
    no change here wrt. our connection isolation design.

  * Localization
  - Import new translations from Transifex.

  * Test suite
  - Fix old ISO checking for consistent error reporting.
  - Remove custom persistence test from manual test suite.
    It was removed for the GUI in t-p-s 0.33.

  - Fix Git access to https:// repositories.

  * Minor improvements
  - Install Dasher, a predictive text entry tool.
  - Add a wrapper around TrueCrypt which displays a warning about it soon

  - Remove Pidgin libraries for all protocols but IRC and Jabber/XMPP.
    Many of the other protocols Pidgin support are broken in Tails and
    haven't got any security auditting.
  - Disable the pre-defined Pidgin accounts so they do not auto-connect
    on Pidgin start.
  - Include information about Alsa in WhisperBack reports.
  - Explicitly restrict access to ptrace. While this setting was enabled
    by default in Debian's Linux 3.9.6-1, it will later disabled in 3.9.7-1.
    It's unclear what will happen next, so let's explicitly enable it ourselves.
  - Do not display dialog when a message is sent in Claws Mail.
  - Sync iceweasel preferences with the Torbrowser's.

  * Localization
  - Many translation updates all over the place.
  - Merge all Tails-related POT files into one, and make use of intltoolize
    for better integration with Transifex.

tails (0.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * Major new features
  - Install Linux kernel 3.9.5-1 from Debian unstable.
    Features of particular interest for Tails are the Yama LSM
    (ptrace scope restrictions) and improved hardware support.
    As a corollary, install initramfs-tools from there too.
  - Iceweasel 17.0.7esr + Torbrowser patches.
  - Unblock Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, WWAN and WiMAX; block every other type of
    wireless device. Next steps are described on the
    todo/protect_against_external_bus_memory_forensics ticket.

  * Bugfixes
  - Fix write access to boot medium at the block device level,
    by installing bilibop-udev. Thanks to quidame for his support.
  - tails-greeter l10n-related fixes, thanks to winterfairy:
    · Fix so translations is applied on password mismatch messages.
    · Separate forward and login buttons and make them translatable.
  - Fix link to documentation when no sudo password is set.
  - gpgApplet: partial fix for clipboard emptying after a wrong passphrase
    was entered.
  - Workaround aufs bug in Unsafe Browser script.

  * Minor improvements
  - Drop GNOME proxy settings: we did not find any use of it we were keen
    to support, other than two programs (Seahorse, Pidgin) that are now run
    with torsocks.
  - Format newly created persistent volumes as ext4.
  - GnuPG: don't connect to the keyserver specified by the key owner.
    This feature opens the door to a variety of subtle attacks.
  - GnuPG: locate keys only from local keyrings.
    This is probably the default, but better safe than sorry.
  - Install virt-what from Wheezy.
    The version from Squeeze does not detect at least Parallels for Mac v.8.
  - Upgrade live-boot and live-config to the 3.0.x final version from Wheezy.
    · Remove /live and /lib/live/image compatibility symlinks.
    · Add /live/overlay -> /lib/live/mount/overlay symlink.
      The live-boot changes (commit d2b2a461) brought to fix Debian bug
      #696495 revert some of our previous changes (commit 77dab1cb), and as
      a result, at the time live-persist runs, no tmpfs is mounted on
      /live/overlay, which breaks the aufs mount. So, let's just ensure
      /live/overlay points to a tmpfs.
    · Really disable policykit and sudo live-config hooks.
      ... by making it believe they've already been run.
      This workarounds new live-config's default behavior.

  * Localization
  - Many translation updates all over the place.

  * Test suite
  - Re-enable previously disabled boot device permissions test.

tails (0.18) unstable; urgency=low

  * New features
  - Support obfs3 bridges.
  - Automatically install a custom list of additional packages chosen by
    the user at the beginning of every working session, and upgrade them
    once a network connection is established (technology preview).

  * Iceweasel
  - Upgrade to Iceweasel 17.0.6esr-0+tails1~bpo60+1.
  - Update Torbrowser patches to current maint-2.4 branch (567682b).
  - Isolate DOM storage to first party URI, and enable DOM storage:
    don't set dom.storage.enabled anymore, and set Torbutton's
    disable_domstorage to false.
  - Isolate the image cache per url bar domain.
  - Torbutton 1.5.2, and various prefs hacks to fix breakage:
    · Add .saved version of the Torbutton preferences the TBB also sets.
    · Set TOR_SOCKS_HOST and TOR_SOCKS_PORT.
    · Move some prefs (network.proxy.*, extensions.autoDisableScopes,
      extensions.foxyproxy.last-version) to user.js.
      Else, with Torbutton 1.5.x, these ones are not taken into account.
    · Set network.proxy.socks_version.
      Else we get the meaningless user_pref("network.proxy.socks_version", 9063);
      in prefs.js after the initial startup.
    · Set extensions.foxyproxy.socks_remote_dns to true.
      Else, it overrides the various ways we set network.proxy.socks_remote_dns,
      which in turn makes Torbutton think it should start in non-Tor mode.
    · Also pass the TOR_SOCKS_* environment variables to iceweasel when
      generating the profile: Torbutton behaves differently depending on
      these variables, so we don't want the initial profile generation to be
      done without them. In practice, this has no implication that we could
      see right now, but better safe than sorry.
    · Import all version overrides from the TBB prefs.
      Else, the User-Agent sent in the HTTP headers is fine, but real
      values leak with JavaScript, as demonstrated by ip-check's "Browser
      type" test.
    · Move a bunch of settings to user_pref(), that are not applied otherwise.
      For some, this fixes a regression in 0.18~rc1.
      For other, the  bug was already present in Tails 0.17.2.
  - HTTPS Everywhere 3.2.
  - Update prefs to match the TBB's, fix bugs, and take advantage of the latest
    Torbrowser patches:
    · Increase pipeline randomization.
    · Fix @font-face handling of local() fonts.
      Also disable fallback font rendering.
    · Explicitly disable SPDY v2 and v3.
    · Update http pipelining prefs.
  - Make prefs organization closer to the TBB's:
    · Remove Torbutton prefs that we set at their default value.
    · Import Torbutton preferences from the TBB.
    · Organize iceweasel config files in sections the same way as the TBB.
  - Cleanup prefs:
    · Don't set extensions.torbutton.clear_cookies nor
      extensions.torbutton.saved.share_proxy_settings:
      we don't care about toggling anymore.
    · Don't set extensions.torbutton.saved.download_retention nor
      extensions.torbutton.saved.search_suggest:
      these settings are not used in Torbutton anymore.
  - Update unsafe browser prefs mangling accordingly.
  - Move network.protocol-handler.warn-external.* to user_pref().
    Else they're not applied.
    These prefs are actually ignored by Firefox these days -- the TBB
    design doc reads "They are set still anyway out of respect for the
    dead". Let's go on doing the same.
  - Update extensions.adblockplus.currentVersion.
  - Fetch xul-ext-https-everywhere (3.2-2) and xul-ext-noscript (2.6.6.1-1)
    from Debian unstable. They were uploaded there, and accordingly removed
    from experimental.

  * Bugfixes
  - Linux 3.2.41-2+deb7u2.
  - Fixed swapped filenames of tails-{reboot,shutdown}.desktop.
    Thanks to Mikko Harhanen for the patch.
  - Only add ClientTransportPlugin to torrc when bridge mode is enabled.
    This should bring back support for proxies of type other than obfsproxy.

  * Minor improvements
  - Set kernel.dmesg_restrict=1, and make /proc/<pid>/ invisible
    and restricted for other users. It makes it slightly harder for an attacker
    to gather information that may allow them to escalate privileges.
  - Install gnome-screenshot.
  - Don't disable IPv6 on all network interfaces anymore.
    It turns out the IPv6 leaks we wanted to fix actually don't exist.
  - Add a "About Tails" launcher in the System menu.
  - Install GNOME accessibility themes.
  - Use 'Getting started...' as the homepage for Tails documentation button.
  - Stop relying on the obsolete /live/image compatibility symlink.
  - Disable audio preview in Nautilus.
  - Wheezy was released => Squeeze is now oldstable.
  - Pick Tor from deb.torproject.org regardless of the release name they
    advertise. At some point we needed it, their APT repository still thought
    that stable == Squeeze.
  - Add Wheezy APT sources.
  - Install Linux and related packages from Wheezy.
    Debian sid just got Linux 3.8, and we don't want to switch to a new kernel
    yet.
  - Fetch laptop-mode-tools from Wheezy.
    Wheezy has the version we've been installing in 0.18~rc1,
    while a newer one was uploaded to sid in the meantime.
  - Fetch a few packages from Wheezy instead of unstable.
    Namely: spice-vdagent, libregexp-common-perl, macchanger, service-wrapper,
    libservice-wrapper-java and libservice-wrapper-jni.
    Wheezy has the versions we've been installing for a while, so let's
    avoid having unstable push a newer one to us uselessly at some point.
    Note that at the time of this writing, the versions in sid and in Wheezy
    are the same, so this commit is effectively a no-op as of today: it is
    merely a safeguard for the future.

  * Localization
  - Many translation updates all over the place.

  * Build process
  - Make Vagrant's build-tails script support Jenkins too.

  * Test suite
  - Fix Unsafe Browser test broken by hidepid.

 -- Tails developers <tails@boum.org>  Mon, 13 May 2013 22:17:38 +0200

tails (0.17.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Iceweasel
  - Upgrade to Iceweasel 17.0.5esr-0+tails2~bpo60+1.
  - Stop displaying obsolete context menu entries ("Open Tor URL" and friends).

  * Hardware support
  - Update Linux to 3.2.41-2

  * Bugfixes
  - Use more reliable OpenPGP keyservers:
    · use the hkps pool in GnuPG (and import their SSL CA)
    · use hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net in Seahorse (as it does not support
      hkps yet)
  - Keep udisks users (GNOME Disk Utility, tails-persistence-setup, etc.)
    from resetting the system partition's attributes when manipulating the
    partition table. To this end, backport the relevant bugfix from Wheezy
    into parted 2.3-5+tails1. This allowed to remove the sgdisk-based
    workaround in tais-persistence-setup, and to stop installing
    python-parted. All this is a first needed step to fix
    todo/make_system_disk_read-only in a future release.

  * Minor improvements
  - Disable NoScript's HTML5 media click-to-play for better user experience.

  * Localization
  - Tails USB installer: update translations for French, German, Spanish,
    Finnish, Greek, Italian, Latvian, Dutch, Polish and Chinese.
  - Tails Greeter: update translations for Farsi, Chinese, French;
    new translations: Finnish, Norwegian Bokmål, Galician.
  - tails-persistence-setup: update Farsi and Chinese translations;
    import new translations for Finnish and Swedish.
  - WhisperBack: update translations for Arabic, French, German, Greek,
    Spanish, Korean, Polish, Russian. New translations: Finnish, Chinese.

  * Build process
  - Add automated testing framework (Sikuli, Cucumber, libvirt -based)
    with a bunch of tests.

 -- Tails developers <amnesia@boum.org>  Sun, 07 Apr 2013 12:17:26 +0200

tails (0.17.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Iceweasel
  - Upgrade to Iceweasel 17.0.4esr-0+tails1~bpo60+1.

  * Hardware support
  - Update Linux to 3.2.39-2.
    It includes the drm and agp subsystems from Linux 3.4.29.
  - Don't install xserver-xorg-video-rendition backport.
    xserver-xorg-video-rendition has been removed from squeeze-backports
    due to an upstream tarball mismatch discover when merging backports
    into the main Debian archive, and xserver-xorg-video-all still depends
    on it, so we explicitly install all drivers from -all but -rendition
    as a (hopefully temporary) workaround.

  * Minor improvements
  - Remove Indymedia IRC account, until we ship a version of Pidgin
    with SASL support, that is when Tails is based on Wheezy.

  * Build system
  - Don't ship the wiki's todo and bugs on ISO images.

 -- Tails developers <amnesia@boum.org>  Thu, 21 Mar 2013 18:54:11 +0100

tails (0.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * New features
  - Install the KeePassX password manager, with a configuration and
    documentation that makes it easy to persist the password database.

  * Iceweasel
  - Upgrade to Iceweasel 17.0.3esr-1+tails1~bpo60+1.
  - Install xul-ext-adblock-plus from squeeze-backports.
  - Do not allow listing all available fonts.
    Set browser.display.max_font_attempts and browser.display.max_font_count
    to enable the Torbrowser Limit-the-number-of-fonts-per-document patch.
  - Set default spellchecker dictionary to English (USA),
    and localize it according to locale with our custom branding extension.
  - Disable the add-ons automatic update feature.
  - Make the generated profile world-readable.
  - Remove NoScript click-to-play confirmation.
  - Sync some prefs set by Torbutton, to be ready when it stops setting these.
  - Disable navigation timing.
  - Disable SPDY. It stores state and may have keepalive issues.
  - More aggressive iceweasel HTTP pipelining settings.
  - Enable WebGL (as click-to-play only).
  - Disable network.http.connection-retry-timeout.
  - Disable full path information for plugins.
  - Remove NoScript blocks of WebFonts.
  - Disable DOM storage in Torbutton.
    Since we don't apply the 0026-Isolate-DOM-storage-to-first-party-URI.patch
    Torbrowser patch yet, and still disable DOM storage, we need to tell
    Torbutton not to use it.
  - Synchronize iceweasel's general.useragent.override with TBB based on FF17.
    The User-Agent settings are not kept up-to-date anymore in Torbutton, so
    we have to keep in sync manually with TBB's settings.
  - Remove obsolete APT pining for Torbutton.
    It's not maintained in Debian anymore, so we now fetch it from our own
    APT repository.
  - Fetch FoxyProxy from Debian experimental and libnspr4-0d from
    squeeze-backports, for compatibility with Iceweasel 17.
  - Rebase bookmarks file on top of the default iceweasel 17 one.
  - Explicitly disable AdBlock Plus "correct typos" feature.
    This feature connects to http://urlfixer.org/.
    It is disabled by default in 2.2-1, but let's be careful.

  * Minor improvements
  - Upgrade to live-boot 3.0~b11-1 and live-config 3.0.12-1.
    Accordingly update the 9980-permissions hook, live-persist,
    unsafe-browser and boot-profile.
    Add compatibility symlinks from /live to /lib/live, and from /live/image
    to /lib/live/mount/medium, to ease the transition.
  - Check for errors when sourcing live-boot files, e.g. to detect when
    they have been renamed upstream.
  - Don't add "quiet" to the kernel command-line ourselves.
    Else, it appears twice as live-build's lb_binary_syslinux adds it too.
    Historically, we've been adding it ourselves on top of that because
    lb_binary_yaboot does not add it, but since we gave up the PowerPC support
    attempt, we're now only interested in syslinux, so let's make it easier
    for the general case, e.g. when one wants to remove the "quiet" parameter
    as suggested by our "Tails does not start" debugging documentation.
  - Upgrade I2P to 0.9.4.

  * Bugfixes
  - Many bugfixes brought by the Debian Squeeze 6.0.7 point-release.
  - Use the regular GnuPG agent + pinentry-gtk2 instead of Seahorse
    as a GnuPG agent. This fixes usage of OpenPGP in Claws Mail,
    and brings support for OpenPGP smartcards.
  - Enable I2P hidden mode.
    Else, killing I2P ungracefully is bad for the I2P network.
  - live-persist: move error() function before the first potential usecase.
  - Add missing executable bit on restart-tor and restart-vidalia.
  - Add shutdown and reboot launchers to the menu.
    This workarounds the lack of a shutdown helper applet in camouflage mode.
  - Remove Pidgin's MXit and Sametime support.
    ... at least until CVE-2013-0273, CVE-2013-0272 and CVE-2013-0271 are
    fixed in Debian stable. While we're at it, don't force file removal in
    these "set -e" build scripts: fail hard, instead of silently ignoring
    the fact that files may have moved or disappeared.

  * Hardware support
  - Install recent Intel and AMD microcode from squeeze-backports,
    explicitly excluding the iucode-tool package that's not a good idea
    for Live systems.
  - Install firmware loader for Qualcomm Gobi USB chipsets.
    This is needed to have various mobile broadband chipsets work.
  - Upgrade barry to 0.18.3-5~bpo60+1.
    This much improved new version supports more hardware & ISP,
    and does not display dozens of spurious error messages at boot time.

  * Build system
  - Remove APT local cache (/Var/cache/apt/{,src}pkgcache.bin).

 -- Tails developers <amnesia@boum.org>  Sat, 23 Feb 2013 10:37:57 +0100

tails (0.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Minor improvements
  - Replace the too-easy-to-misclick shutdown button with a better
    "Shutdown Helper" Gnome applet.
  - Display ~/Persistent in GNOME Places and GtkFileChooser if it is mounted.
  - Set Unsafe Browser's window title to "Unsafe Browser".
  - Install ekeyd to support the EntropyKey.
  - Install font for Sinhala.
  - Update Poedit to 1.5.4.
  - Kill Vidalia when restarting Tor.
    Doing this as early as possible exposes Vidalia's "broken onion" icon
    to users less.
  - Hide the persistence setup launchers in kiosk mode.
  - Add a shell library for Tor functions.
    These are shared among multiple of our scripts.
  - Install dictionaries for supported languages.
    Install hunspell dictionaries when possible,
    fall back on myspell ones else.

  * Bugfixes
  - Disable IPv6 on all network interfaces.
    This is a workaround for the IPv6 link-local multicast leak that was recently
    discovered. Tails has no local service that listens on IPv6, so there should be
    no regression, hopefully, unless one wants to play with OnionCat and VoIP,
    but those of us should know how to workaround this anyway.
  - live-persist: Fix variable mismatch, fixing probe white-list.
    Tails may previously have been able to list GPT partitions labelled
    "TailsData" on hard drives (!) as valid persistence volumes...
  - live-persist: Fix --media option when no devices are attached.
    Earlier, if it was set to e.g. 'removable-usb' and no USB storage was
    connected, $whitelistdev would be empty, which is interpreted like
    all devices are ok by the rest of the code.
  - Fix SCIM in the autostarted web browser: save IM environment variables
    to a file during Desktop session startup, and export them into the
    autostarted browser's environment.
  - Talk of DVD, not of CD, in the shutdown messages.
  - Make tordate work in bridge mode with an incorrect clock.
    When using a bridge Tor reports TLS cert lifetime errors (e.g. when
    the system clock is way off) with severity "info", but when no bridge
    is used the severity is "warn". tordate/20-time.sh depends on grepping
    these error messages, so we termporarily increase Tor's logging
    severity when using bridge mode. If we don't do this tordate will
    sleep forever, leaving Tor in a non-working state.
    · White-list root to use Tor's ControlPort.
    · Add logging for is_clock_way_off().
    · Remove Tor's log before time syncing.
      We depend on grepping stuff from the Tor log (especially for
      tordate/20-time.sh), so deleting it seems like a Good Thing(TM).
    · Stop Tor before messing with its log or data dir.
  - live-persist: limit searched devices the same way as live-boot.
    If no --media argument is specified, use live-boot's
    "(live-media|bootfrom)=removable(|-usb)" argument to limit devices
    searched for a persistent volume.
  - tails-greeter: do not pass media=removable to live-persist.
    Now that we have autodetection with kernel command-line,
    it should not be needed anymore.
  - Start memlockd after configuring it,
    instead of starting it before and restarting it after.
    This avoids running memlockd twice, and prevents other possibly
    surprising race-conditions.
    As a consequence, also have tails-sdmem-on-media-removal start after the
    memlockd service *and* tails-reconfigure-memlockd: to start the watchdog,
    we need memlockd to be properly configured *and* running.

  * iceweasel
  - Set iceweasel homepage to the news section on the Tails website.
    ... using the localized one when possible.
  - Hide the iceweasel add-on bar by default.
    Now that we don't want to ship the Monkeysphere addon anymore,
    that was the only one displayed in there, we can as well hide the whole bar.
  - Don't hide the AdBlock-Plus button in the add-on bar anymore. Now that
    we hide the whole addon bar, we can get rid of this old
    UX improvement.
  - Do not install a placeholder (fake) FireGPG iceweasel extension anymore.
    It was shipped from 0.10 (early 2012) to 0.15 (late November),
    so the migration period should be over now.
  - Don't install xul-ext-monkeysphere anymore.
    The implication of the current keyserver policy are not well
    understood, Monkeysphere is little used in Tails, and we're not sure
    anymore it would be our first bet for the web browser profile with no
    CA. Let's keep the various configuration bits (e.g. FoxyProxy,
    patching MSVA), though, so that advanced users who are used to have
    Monkeysphere in Tails just have to install the package.

  * Build system
  - Install the "standard" task with tasksel for better consistency in the
    Tails ISO images built in various environments.
  - Install p7zip-full. It's a dep by file-roller, but we explicily use it
    elsewhere, and it's better to be safe than sorry.
  - Remove pinning of libvpx0 to sid.
    This package is part of Squeeze, and not from testing/sid.
    We have been shipping the version from Squeeze for a while.
  - Remove config/chroot_local-packages/ from .gitignore.
    The documented way for "external" contributors to add custom packages
    is to put them in chroot_local-packages, and once we pull we import
    any such package into our APT repo and rewrite the
    history appropriately.
    Also, the ability to add packages in there and not see them in "git
    status" makes it very easy to build tainted ISO images with
    non-standard packages, which makes some of us fear can lead to hard to
    debug situations.
  - Make it clearer what can and cannot be done in terms of local packages.

  * Major new features
  - Persistence for browser bookmarks.
  - Support for obfsproxy bridges.

  * Minor improvements
  - Add the Hangul (Korean) Input Method Engine for SCIM.
  - Add vendor-specific dpkg origin information. This makes dpkg-vendor
    return correct information.
  - Install pcscd and libccid from squeeze-backports. This is needed to
    support, to some extent, some OpenPGP SmartCard readers.
  - Install HPIJS PPD files and the IJS driver (hpijs).
    This adds support for some printers, such as Xerox DocumentCenter400.
  - Optimize fonts display for LCD.
  - Update TrueCrypt to version 7.1a.

  * Bugfixes
  - Do not use pdnsd anymore. It has been orphaned in Debian, has quite
    some bugs in there, and apparently Tor's DNSPort's own caching is
    be good enough.
  - Remove useless iceweasel cookies exceptions. They are useless as
    per-session cookies are allowed.
  - Do not run setupcon on X. This call is only needed on the Linux
    console, no need to annoy the user with a weird "Press enter to
    activate this console" when the open a root shell in a GNOME
    Terminal.
  - Allow the tails-iuk-get-target-file user to connect to the SOCKSPort
    dedicated for Tails-specific software.
  - Fix gpgApplet menu display in Windows camouflage mode.
  - Fix Tor reaching an inactive state if it's restarted in "bridge mode",
    e.g. during the time sync' process.

  * Iceweasel
  - Update iceweasel to 10.0.11esr-1+tails1.
  - User profile is now generated at build time in order to support persistent
    bookmarks.
  - Update HTTPS Everywhere to version 3.0.4.
  - Update NoScript to version 2.6.
  - Fix bookmark to I2P router console.
  - Re-enable Monkeysphere extension to connect to the validation agent.

  * Localization
  - The Tails USB installer, tails-persistence-setup and tails-greeter
    are now translated into Bulgarian.
  - Update Chinese translation for tails-greeter.
  - Update Euskadi translation for WhisperBack.

  * Build system
  - Custom packages are now retrieved from Tails APT repository instead
    of bloating the Git repository.
  - Allow '~' in wiki filenames. This makes it possible to ship
    update-description files for release candidates.
  - Document how to create incremental update kit.
  - Handle release candidates when generating custom APT sources.
  - Remove pinning for xul-ext-adblock-plus.
    It is obsolete since we've added this package to our APT repository.

tails (0.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Major new features
  - Enable Tor stream isolation; several new SocksPorts with
    appropriate Isolate* options have been added for different use
    cases (i.e. applications). All application's have been
    reconfigured to use these new SocksPorts, which should increase
    anonymity by making it more difficulte to correlate traffic from
    different applications or "online identities".
  - The web browser now has the anonymity enhancing patches from the
    TorBrowser applied.
  - gpgApplet can now handle public-key cryptography.
  - Install an additional, PAE-enabled kernel with NX-bit
    support. This kernel is auto-selected when the hardware supports
    it and will:
    * provide executable space protection, preventing certain types of
      buffer overflows from being exploitable.
    * enable more than 4 GiB of system memory.
    * make all processors/cores available, including their
      power-saving functionality.
  - Add a persistence preset for NetworkManager connections.

  * Minor improvements
  - On kexec reboot, make the boot quiet only if debug=wipemem was not
    enabled.
  - Update torproject.org's APT repo key.
  - Update the embedded Tails signing key.
  - Use symlinks instead of duplicating localized searchplugins.
  - Rewrite Tails firewall using ferm. Tails firewall was written in
    very unsophisticated iptables-save/restore format. As more feature
    creeped in, it started to be quite unreadable.
  - Optimize VirtualBox modules build at runtime to avoid installing the
    userspace utils N times.
  - Drop most of Vidalia's configuration. Our custom lines just caused
    trouble (with multiple SocksPorts) and the default works well.
  - Blacklist PC speaker module. On some computers, having the pcspkr
    module loaded means loud beeps at bootup, shutdown and when using
    the console. As it draws useless attention to Tails users, it is
    better to prevent Linux from loading it by default.
  - Remove all addons from the Unsafe Browser. No addons are essential
    for the Unsafe Browser's intent. If anything they will modify the
    network fingerprint compared to a normal Iceweasel install, which
    is undesirable.
  - Prevent some unwanted packages to be installed at all, rather than
    uninstalling them later. This should speed up the build a bit.
  - Add a symlink from /etc/live/config to /etc/live/config.d. This
    makes the system compatible with live-config 3.0.4-1, without
    breaking backward compatibility with various parts of the system
    that use the old path.
  - Do not run unecessary scripts during shutdown sequence, to make
    shutdown faster.
  - Make live-persist deal with persistent ~/.gconf subdirs so that
    any options saved therein actually get persistent.
  - Prevent memlockd unload on shutdown, to make sure that all
    necessary tools for memory wiping are available when the new
    kernel has kexec'd.
  - Patch initscripts headers instead of fiddling with update-rc.d. We
    now let insserv figure out the correct ordering for the services
    during startup and shutdown, i.e. use dependency-based boot
    sequencing.
  - Remove the last absolute path in our isolinux config, which makes
    it easier to migrate from isolinux to syslinux (just rename the
    directory), and hence might make it easier for 3rd party USB
    installers (like the Universal USB Installer) to support Tails.

  * Bugfixes
  - Include `seq` in the ramdisk environment: it is used to wipe more
    memory. This fixes the long-standing bug about Tails not cleaning
    all memory on shutdown.
  - Fix Yelp crashing on internal links
  - Allow amnesia user to use Tor's TransPort. This firewall exception
    is necessary for applications that doesn't have in-built SOCKS
    support and cannot use torsocks. One such example is Claws Mail,
    which uses tsocks since torsocks makes it leak the hostname. This
    exception, together with Tor's automatic .onion mapping makes
    Claws Mail able to use hidden service mail providers again.
  - Force threads locking support in Python DBus binding. Without this
    liveusb-creator doesn't work with a PAE-enabled kernel.
  - Fix localized search plugins for 'es' and 'pt'
  - Fix live-boot's readahead, which caused an unnecessary pause
    during boot.
  - Factorize GCC wanted / available version numbers in VirtualBox
    modules building hook. This, incidentally, fixes a bug caused by
    duplication and not updating all instances.
  - Fix tordate vs. Tor 0.2.3.x. Since 0.2.3.x Tor doesn't download a
    consensus for clocks that are more than 30 days in the past or 2
    days in the future (see commits f4c1fa2 and 87622e4 in Tor's git
    repo). For such clock skews we set the time to the Tor authority's
    cert's valid-after date to ensure that a consensus can be
    downloaded.

  * Tor
  - Update to version 0.2.3.24-rc-1~~squeeze+1, a new major
    version. It's not a stable release, but we have been assured by
    the Tor developers that this is the right move.
  - Stop setting custom value for the Tor LongLivedPorts
    setting. Gobby's port was upstreamed in Tor 0.2.3.x.

  * Iceweasel
  - Update to 10.0.10esr-1+tails1, which has all the anonymity enhancing
    patches from the TorBrowser applied.
  - Install iceweasel from our own repo, http://deb.tails.boum.org.
  - Fix Iceweasel's file associations. No more should you be suggested
    to open a PDF in the GIMP.

  * htpdate
  - Use curl instead of wget, and add a --proxy option passed through
    to curl.
  - Remove the --fullrequest option, we don't need it anymore.
  - Remove --dns-timeout option, we don't need it anymore.
  - Change --proxy handling to support Debian Squeeze's curl.
  - Clarify what happens if --proxy is not used.
  - Compute the median of the diffs more correctly.

  * Hardware support
  - Update Linux to 3.2.32-1.

  * Software
  - Update vidalia to 0.2.20-1+tails1.
  - Update bundled WhisperBack package to 1.6.2:
    * Raise the socket library timeout to 120 seconds
    * Use smtplib's timeout parameter
    * Fix error output when calling send a 2nd time
  - Update liveusb-creator to 3.11.6-3.
  - Update i2p to 0.9.2.
  - Update tails-persistence-setup to 0.20-1, which should make it
    possible to install Tails on large (>= 32 GiB) USB drives.
  - Install console-setup and keyboard-configuration from unstable
    (required by new initramfs-tools).
  - Update tails-greeter to 0.7.3:
    * Import pt_BR translation.
    * Let langpanel usable during option selection stage
    * Print less debugging messages by default
    (below are changes in tails-greeter 0.7.2:)
    * Use correct test operators.
    * Generate language codes of available locales at package build
      time.
    * Read list of language codes from where we have saved it at
      package build time.
    * Drop tails-lang-helper, not used anymore.
    * Do not compile locales at login time anymore. Tails now ships
      locales-all.
  - Import live-config{,-sysvinit} 3.0.8-1. live-config >= 3.0.9-1
    has basically nothing useful for us, and it migrates to new paths
    brought by live-boot 3.0~b7, which we're not ready for yet (see:
    todo/newer_live-boot).

  * Localization
  - Fix Tails specific Iceweasel localization for pt-BR
  - Add Japanese input system: scim-anthy.
  - whisperback is now also translated into German, Hebrew, Hungarian,
    Italian and Korean.
  - tails-persistence-setup is now also translated into Arabic.
  - tails-greeter is now also translated into Arabic, Hebrew, Basque,
    Hungarian, Italian and Chinese.

  * Build system
  - Catch more errors in during build time:
    - Ensure that all local hooks start with 'set -e'.
    - Fail hard if adduser fails in local hooks.
    - Fail hard if 'rm' fails in local hooks.
  - vagrant: Ensure we have the set of Perl packages needed by our
    Ikiwiki
  - vagrant: Configure live-build to ship with ftp.us.debian.org.
    Using cdn.debian.net leads to bad interactions with Tor.
  - vagrant: Don't use gzip compression when building from a tag, i.e.
    a release.
  - vagrant: Optionally use bootstrap stage cache for faster builds
    via the 'cache' build option.
  - vagrant: Make sure release builds are clean, i.e. they don't use
    any potentially dangerous build options.
  - vagrant: Disable live-build package caching. This build system is
    meant to use an external caching proxy, so live-build's cache just
    wastes RAM (for in-memory builds) or disk space.
  - vagrant: use aufs magic instead of copying source into tmpfs.
    This reduces the amount of RAM required for building Tails in.
  - vagrant: Allow in-memory builds when a VM with enough memory is
    already started.

tails (0.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Major new features
  - Use white-list/principle of least privelege approach for local services.
    Only users that need a certain local (i.e. hosted on loopback) service
    (according to our use cases) are granted access to it by our firewall;
    all other users are denied access.
  - Ship a first version of the incremental update system. Updates are not
    currently triggered automatically, but this will allow tests to be done
    on larger scales.

  * Minor improvements
  - Enable four workspaces in the Windows XP camouflage. This allows
    users to quickly switch to a more innocent looking workspace in case
    they are working on sensitive data and attract unwanted attention.
    The workspace switcher applet isn't there, though, since there's no
    such thing in Windows XP, so switching is only possible via keyboard
    shortcuts.
  - Ship with precompiled locales instead of generating them upon login.
  - Add support for wireless regulation.
  - Use color for Git output, not intended for machine consumption,
    written to the terminal.
  - Have ttdnsd use OpenDNS. Using Google's DNS servers was very
    glitchy, and rarely succeeded when it should. It can probably be
    attributed to Google's DNS, which is known to take issue with Tor
    exits.
  - Upgrade WhisperBack to 1.6, with many UI improvements and new translations.
  - Include GDM logs and dmidecode informations in the reports.
  - Allow to modify language and layout in the "Advanced options" screen
    of the greeter.
  - GnuPG: bump cert-digest-algo to SHA512.
  - Update torproject.org's APT repo key.

  * Bugfixes
  - Make Claws Mail save local/POP emails in its dot-directory. The
    default is to save them at ~/Mail, which isn't included in our
    current Claws Mail persistence preset.
  - Fix the System Monitor applet.
  - Remove broken ttdnsd from the default DNS resolution loop.
  - Hide the 'TailsData' partition in desktop applications.
  - Ship unrar-free again, so that the GNOME archive manager knows about
    it.
  - Ship with an empty whitelist for Noscript.
  - Disable FoxyProxy's advertisement on proxy error page.
  - Fix slow browsing experience for offline documentation.
  - Raise the socket timeout to 120 seconds in WhisperBack.
  - Enable the ikiwiki trail plugin for the locally built wiki too.

  * Iceweasel
  - Upgrade iceweasel to 10.0.6esr-1 (Extended Support Release) and install it
    and its dependencies from squeeze-backports.

  * Hardware support
  - Upgrade Linux to 3.2.23-1.

  * Software
  - Update tor to version 0.2.2.39.
  - Update Iceweasel to version 10.0.7esr-2.
  - Update i2p to version 0.9.1.

  * Build system
  - vagrant: Install Ikiwiki from Debian unstable. The 'mirrorlist'
    patches have finally been merged in upstream Ikiwiki. So instead of
    building Ikiwiki by hand, we can now install the package directly
    from Debian unstable.
  - Do not build the ikiwiki forum on the bundled static website copy.

tails (0.12.1) unstable; urgency=low

  This is a brown paper bag release to fix two major problems introduced in
  Tails 0.12.

  * Iceweasel
  - Upgrade Torbutton to 1.4.6.
  - Upgrade AdBlock Plus to 2.1.
  - Update AdBlock Plus patterns.

  * Hardware support
  - Upgrade Linux to 3.2.21-3 (linux-image-3.2.0-3-486).

  * Software
  - Install MAT from Debian backports, drop custom package.
  - Install python-pdfrw to re-add PDF support to the MAT.
  - Upgrade tails-greeter to 0.7.1, which fixes the race condition that
    broke administration password and locale settings on some systems.

  * Boot
  - Remove the Tails specific plymouth theme. The theme interfers heavily with
    the boot process on some hardware.

 -- Tails developers <amnesia@boum.org>  Mon, 17 Sep 2012 13:06:03 +0200

tails (0.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Major new features
  - Add the Unsafe Web Browser, which has direct access to the Internet and
    can be used to login to captive portals.
  - The (previously experimental, now deemed stable) Windows camouflage can now
    be enabled via a check box in Tails greeter.

  * Tor
  - Upgrade to 0.2.2.37-1~~squeeze+1.

  * Iceweasel
  - Upgrade iceweasel to 10.0.5esr-1 (Extended Support Release) and install it
    and its dependencies from squeeze-backports.
  - Add a bookmark for the offline Tails documentation.
  - Update AdBlock patterns.

  * Persistence
  - Allow using larger USB drives by increasing the mkfs timeout to 10 minutes.
  - Tell the user what's going on when the Tails boot device cannot be found.

  * Hardware support
  - Upgrade Linux to 3.2.20-1 (linux-image-3.2.0-2-amd64).

  * Software
  - Install rfkill.
  - Install torsocks. Note that this makes `torify' use `torsocks' instead of
    `tsocks'. The `tsocks' binary is dropped to avoid problems, but remaining
    files (the library) are kept since ttdnsd depends on them.
  - Fetch live-config-sysvinit from sid so that it matches live-config version.
  - Update virtualbox backports to 4.1.10-dfsg-1~bpo60+1.
  - Install pciutils (needed by virtualbox-guest-utils).
  - Install mousetweaks. This is needed to use the mouse accessibility settings
    in System -> Preferences -> Mouse -> Accessibility.
  - Install the "hardlink" files deduplicator.
  - Do not install cryptkeeper anymore. See todo/remove_cryptkeeper for reason.
    Users of cryptkeeper are encouraged to install cryptkeeper via `apt-get
    update; apt-get install --yes cryptkeeper`, open their volume and move
    their to Tails' built-in persistence instead, as a one-time migration.
  - Upgrade I2P to version 0.9.
  - Don't install GParted. GNOME Disk Utility has been on par with GParted
    since Squeeze was released.
  - Upgrade live-boot to 3.0~a27-1+tails2~1.gbp319fe6.
  - Upgrade live-config to 3.0~a39-1 and install it from Debian experimental.
  - Upgrade tails-greeter to 0.7.
  - Upgrade tails-persistence-setup to 0.17-1.
  - Install libyaml-libyaml-perl.
  - Upgrade MAT, the metadata anonymisation toolkit, 0.3.2-1~bpo60+1.
  - Fetch python-pdfrw from backports, drop custom package.

  * Internationalization
  - The Tails website and documentation now has a (partial) Portuguese
    translation.

  * Build system
  - Tails can now be built without using a HTTP proxy.
  - Tails can now easily be built by using Vagrant. See the updated
    contribute/build page for instructions.

  * Boot
  - Remove obsolete noswap boot parameter. live-boot now handles swap on an
    opt-in basis.
  - The squashfs.sort files generated with boot-profile should now be ok which
    makes the generate images boot noticeably faster on optical media. See
    bugs/weird_squashfs.sort_entries for more information.
  - Set Tails specific syslinux and plymouth themes.
  - Add NVidia KMS video drivers to the initrd in order to show our shiny new
    plymouth theme on more systems.

 -- Tails developers <amnesia@boum.org>  Mon, 11 Jun 2012 13:37:00 +0200

tails (0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Major new features
  - Do not grant the desktop user root credentials by default.
  - A graphical boot menu (tails-greeter 0.6.3) allows choosing among
    many languages, and setting an optional sudoer password.
  - Support opt-in targeted persistence
    · tails-persistence-setup 0.14-1
    · live-boot 3.0~a25-1+tails1~5.gbp48d06c
    · live-config 3.0~a35-1
  - USB installer: liveusb-creator 3.11.6-1

  * iceweasel
  - Install iceweasel 10.0.4esr-1 (Extended Support Release).
    Let's stop tracking a too fast moving target.
    Debian Wheezy will ship ESR versions.
  - Install needed dependencies from squeeze-backports.
  - Search plugins:
    · Remove bing.
      bing appeared due to our upgrading iceweasel.
      Removing it makes things consistent with the way they have been
      until now, that is: let's keep only the general search engines
      we've been asked to add, plus Google, and a few specialized ones.
    · Replace Debian-provided DuckDuckGo search plugin with the "HTML SSL"
      one, version 20110219. This is the non-JavaScript, SSL, POST flavour.
    · Add ixquick.com.
    · Install localized search engines in the correct place.
      No need to copy them around at boot time anymore.
    · Remove Scroogle. RIP.
  - Enable TLS false start, like the TBB does since December.
  - Adblock Plus: don't count and save filter hits, supress first run dialog.
  - Install neither the GreaseMonkey add-on, nor any GreaseMonkey script.
    YouTube's HTML5 opt-in program is over.
    HTML5 video support is now autodetected and used.

  * Vidalia
  - Upgrade to 0.2.17-1+tails1: drop Do-not-warn-about-Tor-version.patch,
    applied upstream.
  - Set SkipVersionCheck=true.
    Thanks to chiiph for implementing this upstream (needs Vidalia 0.2.16+).

  * Internationalization
  - Install all available iceweasel l10n packages.
  - Remove syslinux language choosing menu.
    tails-greeter allows choosing a non-English language.
  - Add fonts for Hebrew, Thai, Khmer, Lao and Korean languages.
  - Add bidi support.
  - Setup text console at profile time.
    Context: Tails runs with text console autologin on.
    These consoles now wait, using a "Press enter to activate this console"
    message, for the user. When they press enter in there, they should have chosen
    their preferred keyboard layout in tails-greeter by now. Then, we run setupcon.
    As a result, the resulting shell is properly localized, and setupcon
    sets the correct keyboard layout, both according to the preferences expressed by
    the user in tails-greeter.
  - Don't use localepurge, don't remove any Scribus translations anymore,
    don't localize environment at live-config time:
    tails-greeter allows us to support many, many more languages.

  * Hardware support
  - Linux 3.2.15-1 (linux-image-3.2.0-2-amd64).
  - Fix low sound level on MacBook5,2.
  - Disable laptop-mode-tools automatic modules. This modules set often
    needs some amount of hardware-specific tweaking to work properly.
    This makes them rather not well suited for a Live system.

  * Software
  - Install GNOME keyring.
    This is needed so that NetworkManager remembers the WEP/WPA secrets
    for the time of a Tails session. Initialize GNOME keyring at user
    creation time.
  - Install usbutils to have the lsusb command.
  - Install the Traverso multitrack audio recorder and editor.

  * Miscellaneous
  - GNOME Terminal: keep 8192 scrollback lines instead of the smallish
    default.
  - Replaced tails-wifi initscript with laptop-mode-tools matching feature.
  - Disable gdomap service.
  - Fetch klibc-utils and libklibc from sid.
    The last initramfs-tools depends on these.
  - Set root password to "root" if debug=root is passed on the
    kernel cmdline. Allow setting root password on kernel cmdline via
    rootpw=. Looks like we implemented this feature twice.
  - Append a space on the kernel command line. This eases manually adding
    more options.
  - Rename sudoers.d snippets to match naming scheme.
    Sudo credentials that shall be unconditionally granted to the Tails
    default user are named zzz_*, to make sure they are applied.
  - WhisperBack: also include /var/log/live-persist and
    /var/lib/gdm3/tails.persistence.
  - Add a wrapper to torify whois.
  - Rework the VirtualBox guest modules building hook to support
    multiple kernels.
  - Consistently wait for nm-applet when waiting for user session to come up.
    Waiting for gnome-panel or notification-daemon worked worse.
  - Don't start the NetworkManager system service via init.
    Some Tails NM hooks need the user to be logged in to run properly.
    That's why tails-greeter starts NetworkManager at PostLogin time.
  - Also lock /bin/echo into memory. For some reason, kexec-load needs it.
  - Pidgin: don't use the OFTC hidden service anymore.
    It proved to be quite unreliable, being sometimes down for days.
  - Do not display storage volumes on Desktop, by disabling
    /apps/nautilus/desktop/volumes_visible GConf entry. Enabling that
    GConf setting avoids displaying the bind-mounted persistent
    directories on the Desktop, and reduces user confusion. It also is
    a first step towards a bigger UI change: GNOME3 does not manage the
    Desktop anymore, so volume icons and other Desktop icons are meant to
    disappear anyway. It implies we'll have to move all Desktop icons
    elsewhere. Let's start this move now: this will smooth the UI change
    Wheezy will carry for our users, by applying some of it progressively.

  * Build system
  - Don't build hybrid ISO images anymore. They boot less reliably on
    a variety of hardware, and are made less useful by us shipping
    a USB installer from now on.
  - Append .conf to live-config configuration filenames:
    live-config >3.0~a36-1 only takes into account files named *.conf
    in there. Accordingly update scripts that source these files.
  - Remove long-obsolete home-refresh script and its configuration.

  * Virtualization support
  - Support Spice and QXL: install the Spice agent from Debian sid,
    install xserver-xorg-video-qxl from squeeze-backports.

 -- Tails developers <amnesia@boum.org>  Tue, 17 Apr 2012 14:54:00 +0200

tails (0.10.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Iceweasel
  - Update to 10.0.2-1.
  - Disable HTTPS-Everywhere's SSL Observatory (plus first-run pop-up).
  - Revert "FoxyProxy: don't enclose regexps between ^ and $."
    Currently "http://www.i2p2.de" (and everything similar) is captured by
    the I2P filter, which is incorrect. It seems isMultiLine="false" does
    *not* make RE into ^RE$ any longer.
  - Remove file:// from NoScript's exception lists.
    This will fix the JavaScript toggles in the local copy of the documentation.
  - Update AdBlock patterns.

  * Software
  - Upgrade I2P to 0.8.13.
  - Install libvpx0 from sid.
  - Fetch klibc-utils and libklibc from sid.
    The last initramfs-tools depends on these.

  * Hardware support
  - Upgrade Linux kernel to 3.2.7-1.
  - Install firmware-libertas.
    This adds support for wireless network cards with Marvell Libertas
    8xxx chips supported by the libertas_cs, libertas_sdio, libertas_spi,
    libertas_tf_usb, mwl8k and usb8xxx drivers.

  * Miscellaneous
  - Revert "Set time to middle of [valid-after, fresh-until] from consensus."
    This reverts commit 18d23a500b9412b4b0fbe4e38a9398eb1a3eadef.
    With this vmid clocks that are E minutes back in time may cause issues
    (temporary Tor outages) after consensus updates that happen at the
    (60-E):th minute or later during any hour. Full analysis:
    https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2012-January/000873.html
  - Add the default user to the vboxsf group.
    This will allow the user to get full access to automounted VirtualBox
    shared folders as they are mounted with guid vboxsf and rwx group
    permissions.

 -- Tails developers <amnesia@boum.org>  Thu, 01 Mar 2012 20:26:21 +0100

tails (0.10.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Iceweasel
  - Make Startpage the default web search engine. Scroogle does not look
    reliable enough these days.

  * Software
  - Upgrade WhisperBack to 1.5.1 (update link to bug reporting documentation).
  - Update MAT to 0.2.2-2~bpo60+1 (fixes a critical bug in the GUI).

  * Hardware support
  - Upgrade Linux kernel to 3.2.1-2

  * Time synchronization
    Serious rework that should fix most, if not all, of the infamous
    time-sync' related bugs some Tails users have experienced recently.
    - Make htpdate more resilient by using three server pools, and
      allowing some failure ratio.
    - Set time from Tor's unverified-consensus if needed.
    - Set time to middle of [valid-after, fresh-until] from consensus.
    - Many robustness, performance and fingerprinting-resistance improvements.
    - Display time-sync' notification much earlier.

  * Miscellaneous
  - Fix access to "dumb" git:// protocol by using a connect-socks wrapper
    as GIT_PROXY_COMMAND.
  - SSH client: fix access to SSH servers on the Internet by correcting
    Host / ProxyCommand usage.
  - Pidgin: use OFTC hidden service to workaround Tor blocking.
  - Claws Mail: disable draft autosaving.
    When composing PGP encrypted email, drafts are saved back to
    the server in plaintext. This includes both autosaved and manually
    saved drafts.
  - tails-security-check-wrapper: avoid eating all memory when offline.

 -- Tails developers <amnesia@boum.org>  Sat, 28 Jan 2012 10:00:31 +0100

tails (0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Tor: upgrade to 0.2.2.35-1.

  * Iceweasel
  - Install Iceweasel 9.0 from the Debian Mozilla team's APT repository.
  - Update Torbutton to 1.4.5.1-1.
  - Support viewing any YouTube video that is available in HTML5 format:
    install xul-ext-greasemonkey and the "Permanently Enable HTML5 on
    YouTube" GreaseMonkey script.
  - Stop using Polipo in Iceweasel. Its SOCKS support was fixed.
  - Install from Debian sid the iceweasel extensions we ship,
    for compatibility with FF9.
  - Use Scroogle (any languages) instead of Scroogle (English only) when
    booted in English. Many users choose English because their own
    language is not supported yet; let's not hide them search results in
    their own language.
  - Install Iceweasel language packs from Debian unstable:
    unfortunately they are not shipped on the mozilla.debian.net repository.
  - Install the NoScript Firefox extension; configure it the same way as
    the TBB does.
  - Disable third-party cookies.
    They can be used to track users, which is bad. Besides, this is what
    TBB has been doing for years.
  - FoxyProxy: allow direct connections to RFC1918 IPs.

  * Do not transparent proxy outgoing Internet connections through Tor.
  - Torify the SSH client using connect-proxy to all IPs but RFC1918 ones.
  - Torify APT using Polipo HTTP.
  - Torify wget in wgetrc.
  - Torify gobby clients using torsocks. It does not support proxies yet.
  - Torify tails-security-check using LWP::UserAgent's SOCKS proxy support.
  - Fix enabling of GNOME's HTTP proxy.

  * Software
  - Upgrade Vidalia to 0.2.15-1+tails1.
    · New upstream release.
    · Do not warn about Tor version.
  - Upgrade MAT to 0.2.2-1~bpo60+1.
  - Upgrade VirtualBox guest software to 4.1.6-dfsg-2~bpo60+1,
    built against the ABI of X.Org backports.
  - Upgrade I2P to 0.8.11 using KillYourTV's Squeeze packages;
    additionally, fix its start script that was broken by the tordate merge.
  - Install unar (The Unarchiver) instead of the non-free unrar.
  - Install Nautilus Wipe instead of custom Nautilus scripts.

  * Hardware support
  - Upgrade Linux kernel to 3.1.6-1.
  - Upgrade to X.Org from squeeze-backports.
  - Install more, and more recent b43 firmwares.
  - Upgrade barry to 0.15-1.2~bpo60+1.

  * Internationalization
  - Add basic language support for Russian, Farsi and Vietnamese.
  - Install some Indic fonts.
  - Install some Russian fonts.
  - Add Alt+Shift shortcut to switch keyboard layout.

  * Miscellaneous
  - Support booting in "Windows XP -like camouflage mode":
    · Install homebrewn local .debs for a Windows XP look-alike Gnome theme.
    · Add the "Windows XP Bliss" desktop wallpaper.
    · Added a script that's sets up Gnome to look like Microsoft Windows XP.
    · Add Windows XP "camouflage" icons for some programs.
    · Make Iceweasel use the IE icon when Windows XP camouflage is enabled.
    · Add special launcher icons for the Windows XP theme so that they're
      not too big.
  - Decrease Florence focus zoom to 1.2.
  - Do not fetch APT translation files. Running apt-get update is heavy enough.
  - Add MSN support thanks to msn-pecan.
  - Add custom SSH client configuration:
    · Prefer strong ciphers and MACs.
    · Enable maximum compression level.
     · Explicitly disable X11 forwarding.
    · Connect as root by default, to prevent fingerprinting when username
      was not specified.
  - Replace flawed FireGPG with a home-made GnuPG encryption applet;
    install a feature-stripped FireGPG that redirects users to
    the documentation, and don't run Seahorse applet anymore.
  - Enable Seahorse's GnuPG agent.
  - Blank screen when lid is closed, rather than shutting down the system.
    The shutdown "feature" has caused data losses for too many people, it seems.
    There are many other ways a Tails system can be shut down in a hurry
    these days.
  - Import Tails signing key into the keyring.
  - Fix bug in the Pidgin nick generation that resulted in the nick
    "XXX_NICK_XXX" once out of twenty.
  - Pre-configure the #tor IRC discussion channel in Pidgin.
  - Fix "technology preview" of bridge support: it was broken by tordate merge.
  - Install dependencies of our USB installer to ease its development.
  - Make vidalia NM hook sleep only if Vidalia is already running.
  - Reintroduce the htpdate notification, telling users when it's safe
    to use Tor Hidden Services.
  - htpdate: omit -f argument to not download full pages.
  - htpdate: write success file even when not within {min,max}adjust.
    Otherwise htpdate will not "succeed" when the time diff is 0 (i.e.
    the clock was already correct) so the success file cannot be used
    as an indicator that the system time now is correct, which arguably
    is its most important purpose.

  * Build system
  - Name built images according to git tag.

tails (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Tor
  - Upgrade to 0.2.2.34 (fixes CVE-2011-2768, CVE-2011-2769).

  * Iceweasel
  - Upgrade to 3.5.16-11 (fixes CVE-2011-3647, CVE-2011-3648, CVE-2011-3650).
  - Upgrade FireGPG to 0.8-1+tails2: notify users that the FireGPG Text
    Editor is the only safe place for performing cryptographic operations,
    and make it impossible to do otherwise. Other ways open up several
    severe attacks through JavaScript (e.g. leaking plaintext when
    decrypting, signing messages written by the attacker).
  - Install Cookie Monster extension instead of CS Lite.
  - Always ask where to save files.
  - Upgrade Torbutton to 1.4.4.1-1, which includes support for the in-browser
    "New identity" feature.

  * Software
  - Install MAT, the metadata anonymisation toolkit.
  - Upgrade TrueCrypt to 7.1.
  - Upgrade WhisperBack to 1.5~rc1 (leads the user by the hand if an error
    occurs while sending the bugreport, proposes to save it after 2 faild
    attempts, numerous bugfixes).
  - Linux: upgrade to linux-image-3.0.0-2-486 (version 3.0.0-6); fixes
    a great number of bugs and security issues.

  * Miscellaneous
  - Fully rework date and time setting system.
  - Remove the htp user firewall exception.
  - Saner keyboard layouts for Arabic and Russian.
  - Use Plymouth text-only splash screen at boot time.
  - Color the init scripts output.
  - Suppress Tor's warning about applications doing their own DNS lookups.
    This is totally safe due to our Tor enforcement.
  - Disable hdparm boot-time service.
    We only want hdparm so that laptop-mode-tools can use it.
  - Run Claws Mail using torify.
    It's not as good as if Claws Mail supported SOCKS proxies itself,
    but still better than relying on the transparent netfilter torification.
  - Install HPLIP and hpcups for better printing support.

  * Erase memory at shutdown
  - Run many sdmem instances at once.
    In hope of erasing more memory until we come up with a proper fix for
    [[bugs/sdmem_does_not_clear_all_memory]].
  - Kill gdm3 instead of using its initscript on brutal shutdown.
  - Use absolute path to eject for more robust memory wipe on boot medium removal.

  * Space savings
  - Exclude kernel and initramfs from being put into the SquashFS.
    Those files are already shipped where they are needed, that is in the ISO
    filesystem. Adapt kexec and memlockd bits.
  - Do not ship the GNOME icon theme cache.
  - Do not ship .pyc files.
  - Do not ship NEWS.Debian.gz files.

  * Build system
  - Re-implement hook that modifies syslinux config to make future
    development easier.

tails (0.8.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Iceweasel
    - Update to 3.5.16-10 (fixes DSA-2313-1).
    - FireGPG: force crypto action results to appear in a new window, otherwise
      JavaScript can steal decrypted plaintext. Advice: always use FireGPG's
      text editor when writing text you want to encrypt. If you write it in a
      textbox the plaintext can be stolen through JavaScript before it is
      encrypted in the same way.
    - Update HTTPS Everywhere extension to 1.0.3-1.
    - Stop using the small version of the Tor check page. The small version
      incorrectly tells Tails users to upgrade their Torbrowser, which has
      confused some users.

  * Software
    - Update Linux to 3.0.0-2 (fixes DSA-2310-1, CVE-2011-2905, CVE-2011-2909,
      CVE-2011-2723, CVE-2011-2699, CVE-2011-1162, CVE-2011-1161).
    - Update usb-modeswitch to 1.1.9-2~bpo60+1 and usb-modeswitch-data to
      20110805-1~bpo60+1 from Debian backports. This adds support for a few
      devices such as Pantech UMW190 CDMA modem.
    - Install libregexp-common-perl 2011041701-3 from Debian unstable. This
      fixes the bug: [[bugs/msva_does_not_use_configured_keyserver]].
    - Install hdparm so the hard drives can be spinned down in order to save
      battery power.
    - Install barry-util for better BlackBerry integration.
    - Debian security upgrades: OpenOffice.org (DSA-2315-1), openjdk-6
      (DSA-2311-1), policykit-1 (DSA-2319-1)

   * Protecting against memory recovery
    - Set more appropriate Linux VM config before wiping memory. These
      parameters should make the wipe process more robust and efficient.

 -- Tails developers <amnesia@boum.org>  Sun, 16 Oct 2011 11:31:18 +0200

tails (0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebase on the Debian Squeeze 6.0.2.1 point-release.

  * Tor
    - Update to 0.2.2.33-1.
    - Disabled ControlPort in favour of ControlSocket.
    - Add port 6523 (Gobby) to Tor's LongLivedPorts list.

  * I2P
    - Update to 0.8.8.
    - Start script now depends on HTP since I2P breaks if the clock jumps or is
      too skewed during bootstrap.

  * Iceweasel
    - Update to 3.5.16-9 (fixes CVE-2011-2374, CVE-2011-2376, CVE-2011-2365,
      CVE-2011-2373, CVE-2011-2371, CVE-2011-0083, CVE-2011-2363, CVE-2011-0085,
      CVE-2011-2362, CVE-2011-2982, CVE-2011-2981, CVE-2011-2378, CVE-2011-2984,
      CVE-2011-2983).
    - Enable HTTP pipelining (like TBB).
    - Update HTTPS Everywhere extension to 1.0.1-1 from Debian unstable.
    - Suppress FoxyProxy update prompts.
    - Prevent FoxyProxy from "phoning home" after a detected upgrade.
    - Fixed a bunch of buggy regular expressions in FoxyProxy's configuration.
      See [[bugs/exploitable_typo_in_url_regex?]] for details. Note that none of
      these issues are critical due to the transparent proxy.
    - Add DuckDuckGo SSL search engine.

  * Torbutton
    - Update to torbutton 1.4.3-1 from Debian unstable.
    - Don't show Torbutton status in the status bar as it's now displayed in the
      toolbar instead.

  * Pidgin
    - More random looking nicks in pidgin.
    - Add IRC account on chat.wikileaks.de:9999.

  * HTP
    - Upgrade htpdate script (taken from Git 7797fe9) that allows setting wget's
      --dns-timeout option.

  * Software
    - Update Linux to 3.0.0-1. -686 is now deprecated in favour of -486 and
      -686-pae; the world is not ready for -pae yet, so we now ship -486.
    - Update OpenSSL to 0.9.8o-4squeeze2 (fixes CVE-2011-1945 (revoke
      compromised DigiNotar certificates), CVE-2011-1945).
    - Update Vidalia to 0.2.14-1+tails1 custom package.
    - Install accessibility tools:
      - gnome-mag: screen magnifier
      - gnome-orca: text-to-speech
    - Replace the onBoard virtual keyboard with Florence.
    - Install the PiTIVi non-linear audio/video editor.
    - Install ttdnsd.
    - Install tor-arm.
    - Install lzma.

  * Arbitrary DNS queries
    - Tor can not handle all types of DNS queries, so if the Tor resolver fails
      we fallback to ttdnsd. This is now possible with Tor 0.2.2.x, since we
      fixed Tor bug #3369.

  * Hardware support
    - Install ipheth-utils for iPhone tethering.
    - Install xserver-xorg-input-vmmouse (for mouse integration with the host OS
      in VMWare and KVM).
    - Install virtualbox-ose 4.x guest packages from Debian backports.

  * Miscellaneous
    - Switch gpg to use keys.indymedia.org's hidden service, without SSL.
      The keys.indymedia.org SSL certificate is now self-signed. The hidden
      service gives a good enough way to authenticate the server and encrypts
      the connection, and just removes the certificates management issue.
    - The squashfs is now compressed using XZ which reduces the image size quite
      drastically.
    - Remove Windows autorun.bat and autorun.inf. These files did open a static
      copy of our website, which is not accessible any longer.

  * Build system
    - Use the Git branch instead of the Debian version into the built image's
      filename.
    - Allow replacing efficient XZ compression with quicker gzip.
    - Build and install documentation into the chroot (-> filesystem.squashfs).
      Rationale: our static website cannot be copied to a FAT32 filesystem due
      to filenames being too long. This means the documentation cannot be
      browsed offline from outside Tails. However, our installer creates GPT
      hidden partitions, so the doc would not be browseable from outside Tails
      anyway. The only usecase we really break by doing so is browsing the
      documentation while running a non-Tails system, from a Tails CD.

tails (0.7.2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Iceweasel
  - Disable Torbutton's external application launch warning.
    ... which advises using Tails. Tails *is* running Tails.
  - FoxyProxy: install from Debian instead of the older one we previously
    shipped.

  * Software
  - haveged: install an official Debian backport instead of a custom backport.
  - unrar: install the version from Debian's non-free repository.
    Users report unrar-free does not work well enough.

tails (0.7.1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Vidalia: new 0.2.12-2+tails1 custom package.

  * Iceweasel
  - Don't show Foxyproxy's status / icon in FF statusbar to prevent users
    from accidentaly / unconsciously put their anonymity at risk.
  - "amnesia branding" extension: bump Iceweasel compatibility to 4.0 to ease
    development of future releases.

  * Software
  - Upgrade Linux kernel to Debian's 2.6.32-33: fixes tons of bugs,
    including the infamous missing mouse cursor one. Oh, and it closes
    a few security holes at well.
  - Install unrar-free.
  - Do not install pppoeconf (superseeded by NetworkManager).
  - Upgrade macchanger to Debian testing package to ease development of
    future Tails releases.
  - Debian security upgrades: x11-xserver-utils (DSA-2213-1), isc-dhcp
    (DSA-2216-1), libmodplug (DSA-2226-1), openjdk-6 (DSA-2224-1).

  * Protecting against memory recovery
  - Add Italian translation for tails-kexec. Thanks to Marco A. Calamari.
  - Make it clear what it may mean if the system does not power off
    automatically.
  - Use kexec's --reset-vga option that might fix display corruption issues
    on some hardware.

  * WhisperBack (encrypted bug reporting software)
  - Upgrade WhisperBack to 1.4.1:
    localizes the documentation wiki's URL,
    uses WebKit to display the bug reporting help page,
    now is usable on really small screens.
  - Extract wiki's supported languages at build time, save this
    information to /etc/amnesia/environment, source this file into the
    Live user's environment so that WhisperBack 1.4+ can make good use
    of it.

  * Miscellaneous
  - Fix boot in Chinese.
  - Install mobile-broadband-provider-info for better 3G support.
  - Add back GNOME system icons to menus.
  - tails-security-check: avoid generating double-slashes in the Atom
    feeds URL.
  - Remove "vga=788" boot parameter which breaks the boot on some hardware.
  - Remove now useless "splash" boot parameter.
  - Fix a bunch of i386-isms.
  - Pass the noswap option to the kernel. This does not change actual Tails
    behaviour but prevents users from unnecessarily worrying because of 
    the "Activating swap" boot message.
  - Make use of check.torproject.org's Arabic version.

  * Build system
  - Enable squeeze-backports. It is now ready and will be used soon.
  - Install eatmydata in the chroot.
  - Convert ikiwiki setup files to YAML.

    storage devices unless explicitly asked" part of Tails specification.
  - Make configuration more similar to the Tor Browser Bundle's one.
  - GnuPG: default to stronger digest algorithms.
  - Many more or less proper hacks to get the built image size under 700MB.
  - Compress the initramfs using LZMA for faster boot.

    version (2.0~a29-1).

  * Misc
  - Pidgin/OTR: disable the automatic OTR initiation and OTR requirement.

tails (0.6~1.gbpef2878) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  ** SNAPSHOT build @ef28782a0bf58004397b5fd303f938cc7d11ddaa **

  * Hardware support
  - Use a 2.6.32 kernel: linux-image-2.6.32-bpo.5-686 (2.6.32-23~bpo50+1)
    from backports.org. This should support far more hardware and
    especially a lot of wireless adapters.
  - Add firmware for RTL8192 wireless adapters.
  - Enable power management on all wireless interfaces on boot.

  * Software
  - Install inkscape.
  - Install poedit.
  - Install gfshare and ssss: two complementary implementations
    of Shamir's Secret Sharing.
  - Install tor-geoipdb.
  - Remove dialog, mc and xterm.

  * Iceweasel
  - Set extensions.torbutton.spoof_english to its default true value
    in order to workaround a security issue:
    https://amnesia.boum.org/security/Iceweasel_exposes_a_rare_User-Agent/

  * Monkeysphere
  - Install the Iceweasel extension.
  - Use a hkps:// keyserver.

  * GnuPG
  - Install gnupg from backports.org so that hkps:// is supported.
  - Use a hkps:// keyserver.
  - Proxy traffic via polipo.
  - Prefer up-to-date digests and ciphers.

  * Vidalia: rebased our custom package against 0.2.10.

  * Build system
  - Built images are now named like this:
    tails-i386-lenny-0.5-20100925.iso
  - Use live-helper support for isohybrid options instead of doing the
    conversion ourselves. The default binary image type we build is now
    iso-hybrid.
  - Remove .deb built by m-a after they have been installed.
  - Setup custom GConf settings at build time rather than at boot time.
  - Move $HOME files to /etc/skel and let adduser deal with permissions.
  - Convert to live-boot / live-config / live-build 2.x branches.
  - Replaced our custom live-initramfs with a custom live-boot package;
    included version is 2.0.5-1+tails2.6797e8 from our Git repository:
    git clone git://git.immerda.ch/tails_live-boot.git
  - Install live-config* from the live-snapshots Lenny repository.
    Rationale: live-config binary packages differ depending on the target
    distribution, so that using Squeeze's live-config does not produce
    fully-working Lenny images.
  - Rename custom scripts, packages lists and syslinux menu entries from
    the amnesia-* namespace to the tails-* one.

  * HTP
  - Use (authenticated) HTP instead of NTP.
  - The htpdate script that is used comes from commit 43f5f83c0 in our
    custom repository:  git://git.immerda.ch/tails_htp.git
  - Start Tor and Vidalia only once HTP is done.

  * Misc
  - Fix IPv6 firewall restore file. It was previously not used at all.
  - Use ftp.us.debian.org instead of the buggy GeoIP-powered
    cdn.debian.net.
  - Gedit: don't autocreate backup copies.
  - Build images with syslinux>=4.01 that has better isohybrid support.
  - amnesia-security-check: got rid of the dependency on File::Slurp.
  - Take into account the migration of backports.org to backports.debian.org.
  - Make GnuPG key import errors fatal on boot.
  - Warn the user when T(A)ILS is running inside a virtual machine.
  - DNS cache: forget automapped .onion:s on Tor restart.

  * Documentation: imported Incognito's walkthrough, converted to
    Markdown, started the needed adaptation work.

 -- T(A)ILS developers <amnesia@boum.org>  Sun, 26 Sep 2010 11:06:50 +0200

tails (0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * The project has merged efforts with Incognito.
    It is now to be called "The (Amnesic) Incognito Live System".
    In short: T(A)ILS.

  * Community
  - Created the amnesia-news mailing-list.
  - Added a forum to the website.
  - Created a chatroom on IRC: #tails on irc.oftc.net

  * Fixed bugs
  - Workaround nasty NetworkManager vs. Tor bug that often
    prevented the system to connect to the Tor network: restart Tor and Vidalia
    when a network interface goes up.
  - onBoard now autodetects the keyboard layout... at least once some
    keys have been pressed.
  - New windows don't open in background anymore, thanks to
    a patched Metacity.
  - Memory wiping at shutdown is now lightning fast, and does not prevent
    the computer to halt anymore.
  - GNOME panel icons are right-aligned again.
  - Fixed permissions on APT config files.
  - Repaired mouse integration when running inside VirtualBox.

  * Iceweasel
  - Torbutton: redirect to Scroogle when presented a Google captcha.
  - Revamped bookmarks
      . moved T(A)ILS own website to the personal toolbar
      . moved webmail links (that are expected to be more than 3 soon)
        to a dedicated folder.
  - Don't show AdBlock Plus icon in the toolbar.
  - Adblock Plus: updated patterns, configured to only update subscriptions
    once a year. Which means never, hopefully, as users do update their
    Live system on a regular basis, don't they?

  * Vidalia: rebased our custom package against 0.2.8.
  
  * Claws Mail
  - Install Claws Mail from backports.org to use the X.509 CA
    certificates provided by Debian.
  - Enable PGP modules with basic configuration:
      . Automatically check signatures.
      . Use gpg-agent to manage passwords.
      . Display warning on start-up if GnuPG doesn't work.
  - Set the IO timeout to 120s (i.e. the double of the default 60s).
  
  * Pidgin
  - Automatically connect to irc.oftc.net with a randomized nickname,
    so as not to advertize the use of T(A)ILS; this nickname is made of:
     . a random firstname picked from the 2000 most registered by the U.S.
       social security administration in the 70s;
     . two random digits.
    Good old irc.indymedia.org is still configured - with same nickname -
    but is not enabled by default anymore.
  - Disabled MSN support, that is far too often affected by security flaws.

  * Build $HOME programmatically
  - Migrated all GConf settings, including the GNOME panel configuration,
    to XML files that are loaded at boot time.
  - Configure iceweasel profile skeleton in /etc/iceweasel.
    A brand new profile is setup from this skeleton once iceweasel is
    started after boot.
      . build sqlite files at build time from plain SQL.
      . FireGPG: hard-code current firegpg version at build time to prevent
        the extension to think it was just updated.
      . stop shipping binary NSS files. These were here only to
        install CaCert's certificate, that is actually shipped by Debian's
        patched libnss.
  
  * Build system
  - Updated Debian Live snapshots APT repository URL.
  - Purge all devel packages at the end of the chroot configuration.
  - Make sure the hook that fixes permissions runs last.
  - Remove unwanted Iceweasel search plugins at build time.
  
  * Misc
  - Added a progress bar for boot time file readahead.
  - Readahead more (~37MB) stuff in foreground at boot time.
  - Make the APT pinning persist in the Live image.
  - localepurge: keep locales for all supported languages,
    don't bother when installing new packages.
  - Removed syslinux help menu: these help pages are either buggy or
    not understandable by non-geeks.
  - Fixed Windows autorun.
  - Disable a few live-initramfs scripts to improve boot time.
  - Firewall: forbid any IPv6 communication with the outside.
  - Virtualization support: install open-vm-tools.
  - WhisperBack: updated to 1.2.1, add a random bug ID to the sent
    mail subject.
  - Prompt for CD removal on shutdown, not for USB device.

  * live-initramfs: new package built from our Git (e2890a04ff) repository.
  - Merged upstream changes up to 1.177.2-1.
  - New noprompt=usb feature.
  - Fix buggy memory wiping and shutdown.
  - Really reboot when asked, rather than shutting down the system.

  * onBoard
  - Upgraded to a new custom, patched package (0.93.0-0ubuntu4~amnesia1).
  - Added an entry in the Applications menu.
  
  * Software
  - Install vim-nox with basic configuration
  - Install pwgen
  - Install monkeysphere and msva-perl
  - Replaced randomsound with haveged as an additional source of entropy.

  * Hardware support
  - Build ralink rt2570 wifi modules.
  - Build rt2860 wifi modules from Squeeze. This supports the RT2860
    wireless adapter, found particularly in the ASUS EeePC model 901
    and above.
  - Build broadcom-sta-source wifi modules.
  - Bugfix: cpufreq modules were not properly added to /etc/modules.
  - Use 800x600 mode on boot rather than 1024x768 for compatibility
    with smaller displays.

amnesia (0.4.2) unstable; urgency=low

  New release, mainly aimed at fixing live-initramfs security issue
  (Debian bug #568750), with an additional set of small enhancements as
  a bonus.

  * live-initramfs: new custom package built from our own live-initramfs
    Git repository (commit 8b96e5a6cf8abc)
  - based on new 1.173.1-1 upstream release
  - fixed live-media=removable behaviour so that filesystem images found
    on non-removable storage are really never used (Debian bug #568750)

  * Vidalia: bring back our UI customizations (0.2.7-1~lenny+amnesia1)

  * APT: consistently use the GeoIP-powered cdn.debian.net

  * Software: make room so that {alpha, future} Squeeze images fit on
    700MB CD-ROM
  - only install OpenOffice.org's calc, draw, impress, math and writer
    components
  - removed OpenOffice.org's English hyphenation and thesaurus
  - removed hunspell, wonder why it was ever added

  * Boot
  - explicitly disable persistence, better safe than sorry
  - removed compulsory 15s timeout, live-initramfs knows how to wait for
    the Live media to be ready

  * Build system: don't cache rootfs anymore

 -- amnesia <amnesia@boum.org>  Sun, 07 Feb 2010 18:28:16 +0100

amnesia (0.4.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Brown paper bag bugfix release: have amnesia-security-check use
    entries publication time, rather than update time... else tagging
    a security issue as fixed, after releasing a new version, make this
    issue be announced to every user of this new, fixed version.

 -- amnesia <amnesia@boum.org>  Sat, 06 Feb 2010 03:58:41 +0100

amnesia (0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * We now only build and ship "Hybrid" ISO images, which can be either
    burnt on CD-ROM or dd'd to a USB stick or hard disk.

  * l10n: we now build and ship multilingual images; initially supported
    (or rather wanna-be-supported) languages are: ar, zh, de, en, fr, it,
    pt, es
  - install Iceweasel's and OpenOffice.org's l10n packages for every
    supported language
  - stop installing localized help for OpenOffice.org, we can't afford it
    for enough languages
  - when possible, Iceweasel's homepage and default search engine are localized
  - added Iceweasel's "any language" Scroogle SSL search engine
  - when the documentation icon is clicked, display the local wiki in
    currently used language, if available
  - the Nautilus wipe script is now translatable
  - added gnome-keyboard-applet to the Gnome panel

  * software
  - replaced Icedove with claws mail, in a bit rough way; see
    https://amnesia.boum.org/todo/replace_icedove_with_claws/ for best
    practices and configuration advices
  - virtual keyboard: install onBoard instead of kvkbd
  - Tor controller: install Vidalia instead of TorK
  - install only chosen parts of Gnome, rather than gnome-desktop-environment
  - do not install xdialog, which is unused and not in Squeeze
  - stop installing grub as it breaks Squeeze builds (see Debian bug #467620)
  - install live-helper from snapshots repository into the Live image

  * Iceweasel
  - do not install the NoScript extension anymore: it is not strictly
    necessary but bloodily annoying

  * Provide WhisperBack 1.2 for anonymous, GnuPG-encrypted bug reporting.
  - added dependency on python-gnutls
  - install the SMTP hidden relay's certificate

  * amnesia-security-check: new program that tells users that the amnesia
    version they are running is affected by security flaws, and which ones
    they are; this program is run at Gnome session startup, after sleeping
    2 minutes to let Tor a chance to initialize.
    Technical details:
  - Perl
  - uses the Desktop Notifications framework
  - fetches the security atom feed from the wiki
  - verifies the server certificate against its known CA
  - tries fetching the localized feed; if it fails, fetch the default
    (English) feed

  * live-initramfs: new custom package built from our own live-initramfs
    Git repository (commit 40e957c4b89099e06421)
  - at shutdown time, ask the user to unplug the CD / USB stick, then run
    smem, wait for it to finish, then attempt to immediately halt

  * build system
  - bumped dependency on live-helper to >= 2.0a6 and adapted our config
  - generate hybrid ISO images by default, when installed syslinux is
    recent enough
  - stop trying to support building several images in a row, it is still
    broken and less needed now that we ship hybrid ISO images
  - scripts/config: specify distribution when initializing defaults
  - updated Debian Live APT repository's signing key

  * PowerPC
  - disable virtualbox packages installing and module building on !i386
    && !amd64, as PowerPC is not a supported guest architecture
  - built and imported tor_0.2.1.20-1~~lenny+1_powerpc.deb

  * Squeeze
  - rough beginnings of a scratch Squeeze branch, currently unsupported
  - install gobby-infinote

  * misc
  - updated GnuPG key with up-to-date signatures
  - more improvements on boot time from CD
  - enhanced the wipe in Nautilus UI (now asks for confirmation and
    reports success or failure)
  - removed the "restart Tor" launcher from the Gnome panel

 -- amnesia <amnesia@boum.org>  Fri, 05 Feb 2010 22:28:04 +0100

  - ntfsprogs
  - randomsound to enhance the kernel's random pool
  * Tor
  - install the latest stable release from deb.torproject.org
  - ifupdown script now uses SIGHUP signal rather than a whole tor
    restart, so that in the middle of it vidalia won't start it's own
    tor
  - configure Gnome proxy to use Tor
  * iceweasel
  - adblockplus: upgraded to 1.0.2
  - adblockplus: subscribe to US and DE EasyList extensions, updated patterns
  - firegpg is now installed from Debian Squeeze rather than manually; current
    version is then 0.7.10
  - firegpg: use better keyserver ... namely pool.sks-keyservers.net
  - added bookmark to Amnesia's own website
  - use a custom "amnesiabranding" extension to localize the default search
    engine and homepage depending on the current locale
  - updated noscript whitelist
  - disable overriden homepage redirect on iceweasel upgrade
  * pidgin
  - nicer default configuration with verified irc.indymedia.org's SSL cert
  - do not parse incoming messages for formatting
  - hide formatting toolbar
  * hardware compatibility
  - b43-fwcutter
  - beginning of support for the ppc architecture
  - load acpi-cpufreq, cpufreq_ondemand and cpufreq_powersave kernel
    modules
  * live-initramfs: custom, updated package based on upstream's 1.157.4-1, built
    from commit b0a4265f9f30bad945da of amnesia's custom live-initramfs Git
    repository
  - securely erases RAM on shutdown using smem
  - fixes the noprompt bug when running from USB

  * fully support for running as a guest system in VirtualBox
  - install guest utils and X11 drivers
  - build virtualbox-ose kernel modules at image build time
  * documentation
  - new (translatable) wiki, using ikiwiki, with integrated bugs and todo
    tracking system a static version of the wiki is included in generated

  * build system
  - adapt for live-helper 2.0, and depend on it
  - get amnesia version from debian/changelog
  - include the full version in ISO volume name
  - save .list, .packages and .buildlog
  - scripts/clean: cleanup any created dir in binary_local-includes
  - updated Debian Live snapshot packages repository URL and signing key
  - remove duplicated apt/preferences file, the live-helper bug has been
    fixed
  * l10n: beginning of support for --language=en
  * misc
  - improved boot time on CD by ordering files in the squashfs in the order they
    are used during boot
  - added a amnesia-version script to built images, that outputs the current
    image's version
  - added a amnesia-debug script that prepares a tarball with information that
    could be useful for developpers
  - updated Amnesia GnuPG key to a new 4096R one
  - set time with NTP when a network interface is brought up
  - import amnesia's GnuPG pubkey into the live session user's keyring
  - do not ask DHCP for a specific hostname
  - install localepurge, only keep en, fr, de and es locales, which reduces the
    generated images' size by 100MB
  - added a hook to replace /sbin/swapon with a script that only runs
    /bin/true
  - moved networking hooks responsibility from ifupdown to NetworkManager

amnesia (0.1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Forked Privatix 9.03.15, by Markus Mandalka:
  http://mandalka.name/privatix/index.html.en
  Everything has since been rewritten or so heavily changed that nothing
  remains from the original code... apart of a bunch of Gnome settings.
  * hardware support:
  - install a bunch of non-free wifi firmwares
  - install xsane and add the live user to the scanner group
  - install aircrack-ng
  - install xserver-xorg-video-geode on i386 (eCafe support)
  - install xserver-xorg-video-all
  - install firmware-linux from backports.org
  - install system-config-printer
  - added instructions in README.eCAFE to support the Hercules eCAFE EC-800
    netbook
  * APT:
  - configure pinning to support installing chosen packages from
    squeeze; the APT source for testing is hardcoded in chroot_sources/,
    since there is no way to use $LH_CHROOT_MIRROR in chroot_local-hooks
  - give backports.org priority 200, so that we track upgrades of packages
    installed from there
  * release: include the Changelog and TODO in the generated images,
  in the   /usr/share/doc/amnesia/ directory
  * software: install gnomebaker when building Gnome-based live OS, to
  easily clone myself when running from CD
  * build system
  - build i386 images when the build host is amd64
  - added a version file: /etc/amnesia/version
  - use snapshot live-* packages inside the images
  - setup timezone depending on the chosen build locale
  - rely on standard live-initramfs adduser to do our user setup
    (including sudo vs. Gnome/KDE, etc.)
  - stop "supporting" KDE
  - allow building several images at once
  - migrated most of lh_config invocations to scripts/config
  - append "noprompt" so that halting/rebooting work with splashy
  - moved our own variables to config/amnesia, using the namespace
    $AMNESIA_*
  * iceweasel
  - default search engine is now Scroogle SSL, configured to search pages
    in French language; the English one is also installed
  - never ask to save passwords or forms content
  - configured the torbutton extension to use polipo
  - installed the CACert root certificate
  - installed the SSL Blacklist extension and the blacklist data
  - installed the FireGPG extension
  - installed the CS Lite extension
  - installed the NoScript extension
  - NoScript, CS Lite: replaced the default whitelists with a list of
    trusted, non-commercial Internet Service Providers
  - configure extensions (add to prefs.js):
    user_pref("extensions.torbutton.startup", true);
    user_pref("extensions.torbutton.startup_state", 1);
    user_pref("extensions.torbutton.tor_enabled", true);
    user_pref("noscript.notify.hide", true);
    user_pref("capability.policy.maonoscript.sites", "about:
      about:blank about:certerror about:config about:credits
      about:neterror about:plugins about:privatebrowsing
      about:sessionrestore chrome: resource:");
    user_pref("extensions.firegpg.no_updates", true);
  - install the NoScript plugin from Debian squeeze
  - delete urlclassifier3.sqlite on $HOME refresh: as we disabled
    "safebrowsing", this huge file is of no use
  - torbutton: install newer version from Squeeze
  * linux: removed non-686 kernel flavours when building i386 images
  * compatibility: append "live-media=removable live-media-timeout=15", to
    prevent blindly booting another debian-live installed on the hard disk
  * software: added
  - gnome-app-install
  - iwconfig
  - cryptkeeper: Gnome system tray applet to encrypt files with EncFS
  - kvkbd: virtual keyboard (installed from backports.org)
  - sshfs (and added live user to the fuse group)
  - less, secure-delete, wipe, seahorse, sshfs, ntfs-3g
  - scribus
  * Tor
  - enable the transparent proxy, the DNS resolver, and the control port
  - save authentication cookie to /tmp/control_auth_cookie, so that the
    live user can use Tork and co.
  - autostart Tork with Gnome
  - Tork: installed, disabled most notifications and startup tips
  - added a restart tor hook to if-up.d (used by Network Manager as well),
    so that Tor does work immediately even if the network cable was
    plugged late in/after the boot process
  * $HOME
  - added a nautilus-script to wipe files and directories
  - bash with working completion for the live user
  * polipo: install and configure this HTTP proxy to forward requests
  through Tor
  * DNS: install and configure pdnsd to forward any DNS request through
  the Tor resolver
  * firewall: force every outgoing TCP connection through the Tor
  transparent proxy, discard any outgoing UDP connection
  * misc
  - set syslinux timeout to 4 seconds
  - use splashy for more user-friendly boot/halt sequences
